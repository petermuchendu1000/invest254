"""E2E: BILL-1 (docs/47, migration 0165) — invoices, payments (M-Pesa STK + manual), charges, dunning, revenue.

BEFORE (0001..0164) there were no invoices: a "payment" was the owner pressing Mark paid, add-on prices were never
billed, and the lifecycle moved platforms to past_due/grace/suspended purely on dates.
AFTER (0165): renewals are invoiced in advance (plan + monthly add-ons per brand + pending charges), dunning follows
the oldest unpaid invoice, M-Pesa settlement is idempotent, money records are System-owner only, a platform admin
reads/pays only its own platform, and the System's default platform is never invoiced.
Run: python3 packages/db/_testkit/e2e_billing.py   (needs local PG on /tmp:5433)
