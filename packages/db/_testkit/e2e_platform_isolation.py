"""Aggressive PLATFORM-tier isolation e2e (Issue 1 — migrations 0131..0134).

Stands up a local Postgres, applies the Supabase shim + ALL migrations, then proves the
System > Platform > Site tier model and its STRICT isolation, at two layers:

  GOVERNANCE (SECURITY DEFINER RPCs, as the API calls them):
    * only the system owner (platform_superadmin) can create platforms, assign sites, appoint
      platform admins, and list all platforms;
    * a platform_admin manages ONLY sites/users inside ITS platform; any cross-platform target is
      refused with PLATFORM_SCOPE_FORBIDDEN;
    * a platform_admin cannot appoint another platform_admin, and cannot be demoted by anyone but
      the system owner; the system owner is unchallengeable.

  RLS (defense-in-depth for the public anon/authenticated keys, via signed JWT claims):
    * a platform_admin (role=platform_admin, platform=P1) reads EVERY row of P1's sites and ZERO
      rows of P2;
    * a site admin still sees only its one brand; the system owner sees all; a player only its own.
