"""Aggressive e2e for the default-marketer REMOVE + role-demotion LOCK (migration 0124, BUGLOG #26).

Resets a local Postgres, applies the shim + ALL migrations (0001..0124), then exercises the two
guarded RPCs against every real-life scenario:

  ASSIGN      make-default requires an ACTIVE MARKETER on the actor's own brand (unchanged).
  LOCK        a brand DEFAULT marketer cannot be demoted out of 'marketer' (DEFAULT_MARKETER_LOCKED).
  REMOVE      clear-default ALWAYS works — even when the current owner's role drifted to 'player'
              (the exact live corruption: 1000wins/claudia, cpfmarket/marketer001, muchwins/sheila).
  RE-ENABLE   once removed, the same user can be demoted normally.
  SCOPE       a site-scoped admin can only clear its OWN brand; platform_superadmin is unrestricted.
  IDEMPOTENT  clearing a non-default is a harmless no-op; assigning stays active-marketer-only.
  AUTH        non-admin roles are rejected by both RPCs.

Run: python3 packages/db/_testkit/e2e_default_marketer_lock.py   (needs local PG on /tmp:5433)
