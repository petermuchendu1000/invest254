/**
 * Engagement shaping — legitimate, RTP-preserving player-psychology helpers.
 *
 * These functions shape HOW outcomes are presented and distributed, never WHETHER
 * the player wins or how much the house keeps:
 *
 *  - Variable-ratio reinforcement: winning multipliers are drawn from a spread
 *    distribution (many small wins, occasional larger ones) whose MEAN is pinned
 *    to the calibrated value, so RTP is exactly preserved while win sizes stay
 *    unpredictable.
 *  - Near-miss: a loss whose signed move came within a small band of the win
 *    threshold is flagged so the UI can render "so close!" — the outcome is
 *    unchanged, only the presentation.
 *  - Loss disguised as win (LDW): a win whose payout is below the stake (e.g.
 *    multiplier 1.05x) is flagged so the UI can celebrate it like a win while
 *    still showing the net result honestly.
 *
 * Everything here is deterministic given (serverSeed, position nonce) so the
 * presentation is reproducible and auditable — same provable-fairness discipline
 * as the curve itself.

 *                              heavy tail (rare wins approach the cap) instead of a dead clamp.
 *   • "Most random":           max entropy = least-assuming payout consistent with the mean.
