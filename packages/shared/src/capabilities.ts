/**
 * capabilities.ts — the ONE list of what each tier may see and do in the operator UI (docs/42 §3, P2).
 *
 * Every screen decides visibility with `can(role, capability)`, where `role` is the role the API will
 * actually authorise — the TOKEN's role (during impersonation that is `admin`, never the actor's own
 * tier). `apps/api/src/capabilities.contract.test.ts` calls a representative route of every capability
 * as every tier and fails if the API and this list disagree, so the UI can never again show a control
 * the API refuses, or hide one it allows (the drift behind docs/42 UI-3/UI-6/UI-7).
 *
 * Rows mirror the API gates:
 *   requireSiteAdmin  -> admin + platform_superadmin (a raw platform_admin is refused: it works a brand
 *                        only by opening it, i.e. with an `admin` token)
 *   ownerTier/platform (requireRole("platform_superadmin")) -> platform_superadmin
 *   platformAdmin     -> platform_admin + platform_superadmin
 * and the DB role rules (a site admin moves users only player<->marketer and cannot delete an admin).
