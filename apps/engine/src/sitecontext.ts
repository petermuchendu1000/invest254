/**
 * Per-site pricing context — the multiplexed engine's core building block.
 *
 * The single-tenant engine builds ONE (curve, settlement) from ONE day seed. The multiplexed
 * engine builds one of these PER SITE, so every brand has an independent curve and an RTP
 * calibrated to its OWN economy. This composes the existing, proven CurveGenerator +
 * SettlementEngine with the per-site seed from packages/shared — no change to either class, so
 * all their guarantees (smoothness, RTP calibration, provable fairness) carry over per brand.
 *
 * Determinism: identical (masterSeed, siteId, dateKey, seedVersion, config) always yields
 * byte-identical parameters, so crash recovery can re-price a position under its site + version
 * without reading any secret — exactly as the single-tenant engine does, now per brand.
