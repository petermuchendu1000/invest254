## #46 — The database scoped a site-tier actor by its PROFILE, the API by its TOKEN: impersonation hit the wrong brand, and site-admin RPCs had no brand fence (Issue 1 / F-46) — FIXED (branch `fix/issue1-f46-actor-scope`, migration 0156)
- **What (a) — impersonation mis-scope:** impersonating brand X mints `role='admin', site=X` for the operator's OWN user id. `fn_actor_target_sites()` (used by 22 functions) re-derived an `admin` actor's brand from its profile, so broadcasts, audience counts, category clears and tickets issued while impersonating X landed on the impersonator's HOME brand (for a platform admin, possibly a brand of another platform), and add-on requests for X were refused.
- **What (b) — no DB fence for site admins:** the user/money/brand RPCs (`adjust_balance`, `set_user_role`, `delete_user`, pool/withdrawal switches, `decide_advance`, `set_site_owner`, … 17 in all) only fenced the `platform_admin` branch. For `p_actor_role='admin'` the API was the single guard, which is exactly how the claimless-token escalation (#43) credited other brands' users in production. A demoted admin still holding an `admin` token was likewise unfenced.
- **Evidence (prod, read-only, 2026-09-23):** 6 owner impersonation actions (`actor_role='admin'`, profile `platform_superadmin`); 36 actions by an `admin`-role actor whose profile is now `player` — all BEFORE that demotion (last action Aug 13, demoted Aug 17), so no stale-token abuse occurred, but nothing in the DB would have stopped it. Production function bodies md5-identical to the repo before generation.
- **Fix — migration 0156:** PERMISSION is split from TARGETING, both checked against the actor's real profile. `fn_actor_scope_sites(actor, role)`: owner and platform admin unchanged; token role `admin`/`superadmin` → a genuine site admin's own brand, an impersonating platform admin's platform, an impersonating owner's all brands, anyone else (demoted/stale) NONE. `fn_actor_target_sites` (untargeted bulk) returns the own brand only for a GENUINE site admin, never an impersonator's home. `fn_actor_bulk_sites(actor, role, audience)` = named brands ∩ permission. `fn_assert_actor_site_scope` raises `SITE_SCOPE_FORBIDDEN` and is injected as the first statement of the 17 RPCs (bodies otherwise byte-identical; the e2e asserts the diff is exactly that one line). Add-ons use permission; audience/broadcast/category-clear use the bulk set (new 4-arg `fn_notification_clear_category(…, p_site)`); tickets accept an explicit brand only within permission, else the genuine admin's own brand, else `NOT_AUTHORIZED`. Grants: `service_role` only.
- **API/engine:** every site-tier bulk action now NAMES the token's brand (`scopedAudience`: `sites=[brand]` + the template's default audience); tickets use `adminScopeSite(ctx)`; add-ons refuse a site other than the token's (`SITE_SCOPE_FORBIDDEN`); the engine's `resolveCategory` passes the brand to the 4-arg function.
- **Deploy-order safety:** under the API currently in production (which never names a brand) an impersonated bulk action reaches NOBODY instead of the wrong brand; genuine site admins, platform admins and the owner behave exactly as before. The legacy `superadmin` role (whose untargeted bulk now resolves to nobody) has not been minted since the Sep 22 deploy.
- **Tests:** `e2e_actor_scope_impersonation.py` 37/37 (reproduces both defects on the pre-0156 schema, then proves fence, targeting, bulk, category clear, tickets, add-ons and the one-line RPC diff); `app.impersonation.scope.f46.test.ts` 6/6 (5 fail before the API change); fixtures corrected where an "admin" actor was not a genuine admin (`e2e_default_marketer_lock`, `e2e_platform_isolation` + a cross-brand DB-fence check). Full DB e2e 29/29; npm test 1056/1056; secret scan clean.

## #45 — Audit rows filed under the DEFAULT brand whatever they touched (cross-platform leak via the per-brand audit view) (Issue 1 / F-45) — FIXED (branch `fix/issue1-f45-audit-attribution`, migration 0155)
- **What:** `admin_actions.site_id` was `NOT NULL DEFAULT <default brand>`, and 26 of 50 audit-writing functions plus the API's `recordAction()` never set it. Every such row was filed under the default brand.
- **Evidence (prod, read-only, 2026-09-23):** all 570 `user`-targeted rows on the default brand, 251 of them about users of other brands; 550 `site`-targeted rows (impersonations, pool top-ups, …) about other brands also on the default brand; platform-level actions (platform create/update, global provider/M-Pesa config, templates, add-on pricing) masquerading as the default brand's.
- **Impact:** `GET /platform/sites/:id/audit` (platform admin, `site_id = $brand`) showed the default brand's operators actions taken on OTHER platforms' users (cross-platform leak) and hid each brand's own actions from its platform admin.
- **Fix — migration 0155:** `site_id` nullable, no default (NULL = platform-level, excluded from every per-brand view; the system owner still sees all). `fn_admin_action_site(type, target, detail)` derives the brand of the TOUCHED entity (profiles/marketers, sites, `withdrawal_pool` `site:day`, transactions, advances, notifications; else `detail.site_id`/`detail.after.site_id`). A `BEFORE INSERT` trigger makes that derived brand authoritative (it also overrides a wrong explicit value); with nothing derivable, a GENUINE site admin's untargeted action goes to its own brand and anything else stays NULL — an impersonator's untargeted action is never mis-filed under its home brand. Backfill uses the same rule, keeps deliberately-set non-default sites, and keeps the legacy singleton `game_config` rows (the pre-multitenant era's only brand) on the default brand.
- **Prod dry-run before shipping (read-only):** 550 site + 251 user + 4 expense + 1 affiliate rows move to the brand they concern; 58 platform-level rows become NULL; transaction/pool/advance/per-brand game-config rows untouched.
- **Tests:** `e2e_audit_attribution.py` 22/22 — reproduces the leak pre-0155 (the default brand's audit view shows brand B's actions), then proves backfill, trigger, wrong-explicit override, impersonation → NULL, and the exact per-brand view using the same query as `listAudit`. Full DB e2e 28/28 (576); npm test 1050/1050.
- **Compatibility:** migration-only; safe with the currently deployed API (its `recordAction` inserts are attributed by the trigger; `listAudit` handles NULL).

## #44 — Operator routes addressed a target by id without checking its brand (Issue 1 / F-44) — FIXED (branch `fix/issue1-f44-admin-target-scope`, migration 0154)
- **What:** id-addressed operator routes resolved scope from the caller's token but never checked the TARGET's brand: `GET /admin/users/:id`, `/:id/activity`, `/:id/overrides`; `GET|POST /admin/users/:id/notifications` and `POST /admin/notifications/:id/resolve` (sequential ids; also reachable by a raw `platform_admin` of ANY platform); **all** of `GET|PATCH /admin/marketers/:id`, `/credit`, `/withdraw`, `/fuliza`, `/airtime`, `/statement`, **`/pin`** (reset any tenant's marketer PIN → account takeover), `/status`, `/bulk`; `GET|POST /admin/affiliate/expenses` (and the RPC never checked the marketer's brand while the withdrawable total nets across brands → cross-tenant financial sabotage); `/admin/affiliate/accrue` (any brand, or all). `GET /admin/audit` and `GET /admin/mpesa-config` served cross-brand/global data to every site admin (the UI hid them; the API did not). The remaining moderation routes (withdrawals, affiliate/commission payouts, advances) used a guard that is tolerant of an unresolved target and passed it through to the money RPC.
- **Production forensics (2026-09-23, read-only):** 12 real-money `balance.adjust` actions by a brand-A site-admin account on users of two other brands (Sep 12–14; KES 3,200 total). The wallet route does check the target's brand, so this required a claimless token — i.e. the #43 refresh escalation was used in production (owner to review whether the operator was authorised). Separately, 4 marketer expenses the system owner logged for other brands' marketers were stamped on the owner's home brand (mis-attribution, not an attack) — corrected by 0154.
- **Fix:** new `apps/api/src/scope.ts` — ONE fail-closed tier rule (`assertSiteTarget` / `assertUserTarget`): system → any brand; platform admin → only brands of its platform; site admin → only its brand; an unresolvable target → 404, never passed through. Applied to every route above and to all 11 remaining moderation call sites (the tolerant guard is no longer used by any route; the in-memory payout mirror now resolves a payout's brand like Postgres does). Audit trail + global M-Pesa config → System-owner-only. Expenses are recorded on the MARKETER's brand; a site admin's accrual is confined to its brand. Migration **0154**: `fn_admin_add_marketer_expense` refuses a brand-bounded actor crossing brands (`MARKETER_SITE_MISMATCH`), normalises the global owner's expense onto the marketer's brand (deploy-order safe with the previous API), and re-stamps the 4 mis-attributed rows (amounts/withdrawable unchanged).
- **Regression guard (future-proof):** `app.scope.matrix.e2e.test.ts` reads EVERY id-addressed `/admin|/platform|/tickets|/addons|/support` route from the real router (`Router.listRoutes`, 72 routes) and attacks each as brand B's site admin AND as another platform's admin against real brand-A entities with VALID bodies (only 403/404 pass; 400 counts as a failure so validation can't mask a missing check), then proves brand A untouched (marketer balance/status/PIN, user status/wallet, notifications, advance). **144/144 refused on the fix; on the pre-fix source it reports 19 breaches** (incl. PIN reset 200, marketer credit/withdraw 200, foreign platform admin injecting notifications 201). A new route is attacked automatically. DB: `e2e_marketer_expense_scope.py` 13/13 (reproduces the prod defect pre-0154).
- **Contract change (intentional):** an UNKNOWN id in a bulk withdrawal approve now fails its row (was a silent no-op success); the UI never submits unknown ids and already reports failed rows.
- **Verification:** npm test 1050/1050; DB e2e 27/27 files (554 checks); `tsc -b` clean; secret-scan clean.

## #43 — Token scope loss: re-minted tokens dropped `site`/`platform`, and a claimless site `admin` was read as UNRESTRICTED (every brand, every platform) — FIXED (branch `fix/issue1-f43-token-scope-claims`)
- **What:** four token-mint paths omitted the holder's scope: `POST /auth/refresh` (`issueToken(userId, role)`), `POST /affiliate/enroll`, and both marketer-app logins (`/marketers/auth/login`, `/login-web`). Independently, `adminScopeSite()` returned `claims.site ?? null` for a site `admin`, and `null` means *unrestricted* — the #38 class, which had only been closed for `platform_admin`.
- **Exploit chain (reproduced end-to-end):** a brand-A account is promoted to `admin` → the web sees token-role ≠ live role and calls `/auth/refresh` automatically (`SessionBootstrap.tsx:35`, `useAuthActions.ts:64`) → the refreshed token has no `site` → every `/admin/*` list and every `assertTargetSiteInScope` write treats it as cross-brand → the new site admin reads and mutates users, balances, withdrawals and marketers of **every brand on every platform**. Any site admin could also call `/auth/refresh` directly. A claimless `platform_admin` was fail-closed by #38 (locked out instead of escalated); a partial fix for that case (`03c269c`) sat unmerged. Tokens live 7 days.
- **Fix (two independent halves):** (1) **root cause** — new single choke point `AuthService.issueSessionToken(userId)` re-reads the LIVE profile (`profiles.site_id`, `platform_id`) and stamps role + site + platform exactly as login does; refresh and enrolment use it; marketer-app tokens are stamped with the marketer's brand. (2) **defense-in-depth** — `adminScopeSite()` now **fails closed**: a site `admin` without a `site` claim gets `403 SITE_CLAIM_MISSING`; new `adminListSite()` replaces every raw `ctx.claims.site` read in admin lists/writes so the rule cannot be bypassed. The system owner's behaviour is unchanged.
- **Tests:** new `app.auth.scope.f43.e2e.test.ts` (7): decodes the REAL refreshed JWT and replays its claims — brand-A admin sees only brand A; claimless admin refused on 20 back-office surfaces + a write; platform_admin keeps its platform claim; enrolment and both marketer-app logins keep the brand; owner + scoped admin unaffected. **On the pre-fix source 5/7 fail for the exact reasons** (missing `site`; claimless admin → 200 everywhere). 136 legacy test tokens that encoded "claimless `admin` = all brands" were migrated: 134 to `admin`+`site` (the brand their fixtures live in) and 2 explicit "unrestricted operator" constants to `platform_superadmin`; 2 tests that acted cross-brand now assert the refusal and use the owning brand's admin. Full suite **1044/1044**, `tsc -b` + web build clean.
- **Residual (owner action):** tokens already minted claimless in the last 7 days: `admin` ones are now refused (sign in again); player/marketer ones fall back to the default brand until expiry. Rotating `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET` (BUGLOG #41 action 2) ends all of them immediately.

## #42 — PostgREST TABLE/VIEW surface open to the public anon key: 36 tables without RLS + 14 owner-run views — FIXED in code (branch `security/postgrest-table-surface`, migration 0153); prod state to be confirmed
- **What:** #39/0151 closed the PostgREST **function** surface; the **table/view** surface was never audited. Supabase's default privileges grant `ALL` on every new public table/view/sequence to `anon` + `authenticated`, so RLS is the only gate. In the repo schema **36 of 70 public tables were never RLS-enabled** (incl. `sites`, `platforms`, `marketers`, `marketer_credentials` [PIN hashes], `marketer_wallets`, `commission_payouts`, `withdrawal_pool`, `site_game_config`, `platform_global_config`, `admin_actions`, `system_logs`, `tickets`) and **all 14 public views ran as owner** (no `security_invoker`), bypassing the RLS of the tables beneath them (`v_real_profiles` → every player's phone on every platform).
- **Evidence (reproducible, not inferred):** new `packages/db/_testkit/e2e_postgrest_surface.py` builds the DB under Supabase's real default-privilege posture, seeds two platforms, and attacks as `anon` and as a claimless `authenticated` (Supabase self-signup) JWT. On the pre-fix schema (`E2E_UPTO=0152`) it **fails 37 checks**: anon reads `admin_actions`, `marketer_credentials`, `marketer_wallets`, `platforms`, `sites`, `system_logs`, `tickets`, `withdrawal_pool`, `platform_global_config`, … and succeeds at crediting marketer wallets, flipping the platform withdrawal kill-switch, inflating the pool, forging and **erasing** the audit trail, `TRUNCATE system_logs` (TRUNCATE ignores RLS), re-parenting brands, minting platforms and resetting marketer PINs. Independent static replay of all 153 migrations flags exactly the same 36 tables / 14 views (0 false positives/negatives).
- **Doc correction:** docs/40 §0 stated "`sites`/`platforms`/`marketers` — RLS enabled, 0 policies" from a live read. **No migration enables RLS on those tables**, so either prod drifted out-of-band or that line was wrong (docs/40 also reported "70 RLS tables" — 70 is the *total* table count in the repo schema, of which 34 have RLS). The live state is unverified from this sandbox (egress-blocked); 0153 is idempotent, so it converges whichever is true.
- **Fix — migration `0153_postgrest_table_surface_lockdown.sql`:** (0) **fail-closed guard**: aborts before any change unless the migrating role owns or BYPASSRLS every public table (so it can never lock the app out); (1) RLS on every public table (no policy = deny-all); (2) `security_invoker = true` on every view; (3) anon/authenticated lose INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE wherever no write policy exists for them (only `push_subscriptions` own-row keeps it), lose TRUNCATE/REFERENCES/TRIGGER everywhere, and lose all sequence access; (4) `sites`: no table-wide SELECT for public roles — `authenticated` keeps only `(id, platform_id)`, row-scoped by a **claims-only** policy mirroring `is_site_admin` (no recursion), so the platform branch of RLS keeps working without exposing brand config; (5) default privileges so future tables/sequences are not auto-writable. The `v_real_*`/`v_demo_*` views now **fail closed** for public roles (their marketer classifier is a DEFINER fn that 0151 made non-executable) — deliberately not re-granted, as that would create a cross-tenant "is this user a marketer?" oracle.
- **App impact: none.** API/engine never run as anon/authenticated (no `SET ROLE`, no JWT GUCs, no PostgREST, no supabase-js); they connect as the table owner. Verified: owner row counts identical in all 84 relations; owner writes + SECURITY DEFINER RPCs unaffected.
- **Regression guards:** (a) `e2e_postgrest_surface.py` 50/50 (fix) vs 37 failures (pre-fix); (b) new DB-free `packages/db/migrations.guard.test.ts` in `npm test`/CI fails any future migration that creates a public table without RLS, creates/replaces a view without `security_invoker` (a bare `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW` silently **resets** the option — verified), or grants write privileges to anon/authenticated. Full DB e2e **26/26 files, 541 checks** green.

## #41 — PRODUCTION `DATABASE_URL` (+ API token-signing secret) committed to the PUBLIC repo — FIXED in code (branch `security/remove-committed-e2e-env`); ⚠️ credential ROTATION required (owner action)
- **What:** `.e2e.env` was committed on 2026-08-04 (`f1532eb`) and mirrored to the template. It holds the production Supabase `DATABASE_URL` **with password** and a `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET` value (the variable the API uses to sign every auth token and withdrawal-action link).
- **Evidence (2026-09-23):** `invest254` is public by design (`mirror-sync.yml`: "Reads PUBLIC upstream with no secret"); an unauthenticated `GET https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petermuchendu1000/invest254/main/.e2e.env` returned **HTTP 200**. The committed `DATABASE_URL` is byte-identical to the live production connection string. The committed JWT secret does **not** verify the Supabase project anon/service_role keys (offline HMAC check), so it is not the PostgREST key; whether it equals the API's production signing secret cannot be checked from the repo — treat it as compromised. Full-history secret sweep of both repos: every other hit is a test/dev placeholder.
- **Impact:** the most severe possible scope leak. A direct Postgres connection as the pooler `postgres` user bypasses **every** layer of the isolation model (RLS, API role/scope guards, in-definer platform checks) — read/write every platform's PII, balances, roles, withdrawals. If the JWT secret is the prod value, anyone can also mint a `platform_superadmin` token. Exposure window: ~7 weeks.
- **Code fix:** file removed from HEAD; `.gitignore` now ignores `*.env` / `.env.*` (only `*.example` tracked); new CI gate `scripts/secret_scan.mts` (+ 6 unit tests) fails the build on any tracked env file, a remote Postgres URL with a real password, or real-shaped GitHub/Supabase/Telegram/Cloudflare/Fly/Stripe/private-key/Supabase-JWT secrets — it never prints a value. Verified: gate FAILS on the pre-fix tree (`.e2e.env` flagged), PASSES after (760 files, 0 findings). Nothing in the code read `.e2e.env`.
- **Owner action (cannot be done from code):** (1) reset the Supabase DB password and update `DATABASE_URL` on both Fly apps + GitHub Actions secrets; (2) rotate `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET` on both Fly apps (invalidates all sessions — intended); (3) review Supabase Postgres logs since 2026-08-04 for unknown clients; (4) decide whether the upstream should stay public. History still contains the old value — harmless once rotated; a history rewrite (force-push) is optional and was not done.

## #40 — Legacy `superadmin` tier removed; owner-tier config moved to the system console (Issue 1 / F1 + F2) — FIXED (branch `issue1-remove-superadmin`)
- **What:** the codebase carried a 6th, out-of-hierarchy role `superadmin` (per-brand "owner" tier) that duplicated the site tier in RLS while also holding owner-tier powers, and was minted at runtime as the system owner's site-fenced impersonation token. This muddied the authoritative 5-tier model (`platform_superadmin > platform_admin > admin > marketer > player`).
- **Evidence:** live DB had **0** `superadmin` holders (`select role,count(*) from profiles`), yet the role was wired into `profiles_role_check`, `is_site_admin`, `ROLE_RANK`, `PRIVILEGED_ROLES`, ~273 non-test refs, and the `/platform/sites/:id/impersonate` minting. `is_site_admin` also carried unreachable `finance_admin`/`support` branches (not in the role CHECK, never minted) — F2.
- **Resolution (Option B):** migration `0152_remove_superadmin_role.sql` fail-closed-guards on 0 holders, drops `superadmin` from `profiles_role_check`, and simplifies `is_site_admin` (removing the `superadmin` + dead `finance_admin`/`support` branches). Code: removed `superadmin` from `ROLE_RANK`/`requireSiteAdmin`/`PRIVILEGED_ROLES`/MFA roles/role-set validation and the in-memory admin mirror; **impersonation now always mints a day-to-day `admin`** (system owner and platform admin alike); owner-tier `/admin/*` levers (game/economy config, seed rotation, M-Pesa config, per-brand withdrawal pool, Fly ops, per-user overrides) are re-gated to `requireRole("platform_superadmin")` (System console), and the web owner-tier UI is System-owner-only. The ~29 other `fn_*` keep their harmless `superadmin` allow-list/protected-target literals as inert defense-in-depth (the CHECK now forbids the role); a follow-up (F1c) may sweep them.
- **Impact:** none for live users (0 `superadmin` accounts; owner-tier `/admin` routes were only reachable by the system owner in practice). Site admins do NOT gain owner-tier powers.
- **Tests:** migration applied on ephemeral PG; **DB e2e 25/25 files green**, **TS 1035/1035 green** (backend 960 + web 75), `tsc -b` + web `tsc` clean. New/updated assertions: `superadmin` is not privileged, not assignable via `/role`, owner-tier is System-only, impersonation mints `admin`, fences hold via the `admin` site claim.
- **Deferred (documented):** F1b — allow a `platform_admin` to manage its OWN brands' owner-tier economy (requires widening the economy RPCs with platform scope); F1c — sweep inert `superadmin` literals from the 29 `fn_*` bodies; F1d — brand selector on the System-console owner-tier pages.

## #38 — Cross-tenant leak: a platform_admin with NO platform claim was read as "unrestricted"; an unresolved target was deferred — FIXED (branch `fix/issue1-platform-scope-fail-closed`)
- **What:** A `platform_admin` reached brands in ANOTHER platform. Live audit: actor `51ecc888` (**@thegenius**, `platform_admin`, `platform_id = a8502771…` = **NDUATI**) ran `platform.impersonate` against sites in **MUCHENDU** (owned by **@zrinok**) on 2026-09-21 — **Tamu Traders** (`47e2ab1f…`) and **Invest254** (`00000000-…-001`). "One missing platform claim opens all thirteen brands" (12 MUCHENDU + 1 NDUATI).
- **Evidence:** read-only forensics on prod (`admin_actions`, `profiles`, `sites`, `platforms`) reconstructed the actor/target/platform mapping. New e2e `apps/api/src/app.platform.scope.failopen.e2e.test.ts` reproduces the mechanism against the app: a `platform_admin` token carrying **no** `platform` claim → `GET /platform/sites` returned **200 listing every platform's brands** (expected 403) and `POST /platform/sites/:id/impersonate` on a cross-platform brand returned **200 + a minted admin token**.
- **Root cause:** `apps/api/src/http.ts` `adminScopePlatform()` returned `ctx.claims.platform ?? null`; a **missing** claim → `null` → treated identically to the system owner (unrestricted). `scopeSiteParam` then early-returns and `listSites(null)` returns every platform. Independently, `assertTargetPlatformInScope()` **deferred** (returned) on an unresolved target platform ("defer to the RPC's own guard"). The claim is only minted at login when `profiles.platform_id` is set (`authservice.issueToken` 4th arg), so any `platform_admin` without a `platform_id` — or any path that drops the claim — silently escalates to system-wide.
- **Also caught (latent):** `PgPlatformRepository.platformOfSite()` returned the **string `"null"`** for a site whose `platform_id` IS NULL (`String(null)`), and would **throw on an empty `siteId`** (invalid-uuid cast) — both defeat a fail-closed target check.
- **Impact:** a single-platform admin (or any claimless token) could enumerate, edit, and impersonate-admin **every brand across all platforms** — cross-tenant full access. Blast-radius check on prod: **0** `platform_admin`s with null `platform_id`, **0** sites with null `platform_id` → the fail-closed fix locks out nobody legitimate.
- **Fix:** `adminScopePlatform()` now **throws `PLATFORM_CLAIM_MISSING` (403)** for a `platform_admin` with no platform claim (never `null`=unrestricted). `assertTargetPlatformInScope()` now **refuses an unresolved target** (403 `PLATFORM_SCOPE_FORBIDDEN`) for any bounded caller; only the system owner (null scope) is unrestricted. `platformOfSite()` hardened (empty→null; NULL `platform_id`→null).
- **Verification:** new failopen e2e (3 scenarios: claimless refused; unresolved target refused; legit `platform_admin` + system owner unaffected). `http.platform.test.ts` updated to the fail-closed contract + a claimless-admin unit test. **Full suite 1035/1035 green; `tsc -b` clean.**

## #39 — PostgREST exposes SECURITY DEFINER admin/financial `fn_*` to anon/authenticated; `fn_*` trust the caller-supplied `p_actor_role` — FIXED & DEPLOYED (migration 0151, applied to prod 2026-09-22)
- **Resolution status update (Issue 1 / F3):** migration `0151_revoke_public_function_execute.sql` is APPLIED in production (`schema_migrations`, applied_by `issue1-buglog39`, 2026-09-22). Live grant audit confirms **anon/authenticated can EXECUTE 0 of 152 SECURITY DEFINER functions** (spot-checked `fn_admin_adjust_balance`, `fn_admin_set_user_role`, `fn_platform_appoint_platform_admin`, `fn_admin_delete_user` → all denied). The earlier "pending prod approval" note was stale.
- **What:** Nearly every `fn_*` in schema `public` is `EXECUTE`-able by `anon`/`authenticated`/`PUBLIC`, and the exposed admin/financial functions authorize on the **`p_actor_role` argument** rather than the caller's real role.
- **Evidence (read-only prod):** 90+ public functions granted `EXECUTE` to anon/authenticated incl. `fn_admin_adjust_balance`, `fn_admin_adjust_balance_kind`, `fn_admin_clear_balance`, `fn_admin_delete_user`, `fn_admin_set_user_role`, `fn_admin_rotate_seed`, `fn_approve_withdrawal`, `fn_complete_withdrawal`, `fn_create_withdrawal`, `fn_reject_withdrawal`. Surface is **LIVE**: `POST /rest/v1/rpc/fn_first_name` with only the **public anon key** returned `200 "Test"`. `fn_admin_adjust_balance` (0135) is `security definer` and gates only on the **string** `p_actor_role` (line 24); passing `p_actor_role='superadmin'` also **skips** the platform-scope branch (which only runs for `'platform_admin'`). `fn_platform_*` and `fn_addon_*` are already correctly revoked (the fix pattern exists).
- **Root cause:** the default Supabase EXECUTE-to-anon/authenticated posture was never revoked for the `fn_*` family; functions authorize on a passed-in role instead of `profiles.role`.
- **Impact:** any holder of the public anon key (embedded in the frontend) can call admin/financial RPCs **directly via PostgREST, bypassing the API guard entirely** — adjust any balance, set any role, approve/complete withdrawals, delete users, across all brands. Highest-severity path. No anonymous actor ids in `admin_actions` to date.
- **Fix (PREPARED, not yet applied):** `packages/db/migrations/0151_revoke_public_function_execute.sql` — revoke `EXECUTE` from `anon, authenticated, PUBLIC` on every **`SECURITY DEFINER`** function in `public`; `GRANT EXECUTE … TO service_role`; `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES … REVOKE EXECUTE ON FUNCTIONS FROM anon, authenticated, PUBLIC` (no future function auto-exposes). **Verified safe:** the web app uses no PostgREST/anon RPC (no `@supabase/supabase-js`, no `.rpc(`; all traffic via `fetch` to the API), and the API/engine connect as the `postgres` owner — neither is affected. Idempotent + reversible.
- **⚠️ Refined from the original report (caught by test):** the report prescribed *"REVOKE EXECUTE ON ALL FUNCTIONS"*. A blanket revoke **broke the anon/authenticated RLS read path** — RLS policies call `SECURITY INVOKER` helpers (`current_site`, `is_site_admin`, `current_platform`, `jwt_role`) evaluated with the querying role's privileges, so stripping their `EXECUTE` yields `permission denied for function current_site` (reproduced via `e2e_platform_isolation.py`). Corrected to revoke **`SECURITY DEFINER` only**: DEFINER functions run as OWNER (the actual escalation surface); INVOKER functions run as the caller and cannot escalate, so they stay callable and RLS keeps working. Empirically: 228 anon-exposed pre-fix → **0 SECURITY DEFINER** anon-exposed post-fix, with RLS intact.
- **Regression guard (prepared):** `packages/db/_testkit/e2e_function_grants.py` — fails the build if ANY `SECURITY DEFINER` public function is `EXECUTE`-able by anon/authenticated/PUBLIC, asserts the specific admin/financial RPCs are closed, AND asserts the RLS helpers stay executable (so the fix can't regress into breaking RLS).
- **Deferred (larger, tracked):** rewrite each `fn_*` taking `p_actor_role` to read the actor's real role from `profiles` and ignore the parameter, so a future grant mistake is not a compromise.
- **Status:** PENDING — production DB change; **do not apply without explicit approval**.

## #37 — DB e2e harness silently tested a 30-migration-STALE schema (+ 2 stale test fixtures) — FIXED (branch `issue1-platform-tier`)
- **Surfaced while building Issue 1** (platform tier). Ran the whole `packages/db/_testkit/e2e_*.py`
  suite to establish a regression baseline; 6 of 18 scripts crashed on setup.
- **Root cause A (systemic):** every `reset_and_migrate()` applied migrations with
  `glob("00*.sql")`. That pattern matches `0001`–`0099` but **NOT `0100`–`0130`** (they start with
  `01`). So for a long time the DB e2e suite has been building its test DB from a schema **missing
  the last 31 migrations** — every `v_real_*`/`v_demo_*` view (0101), `min_withdrawal_native` (0120),
  payment-provider config (0130), etc. Any test touching a ≥0100 object crashed; tests that didn't
  simply passed against a stale schema (false confidence). Fixed the glob to
  `"[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]_*.sql"` in all 9 affected scripts (2 others had already fixed it locally with
  a comment about this exact pitfall).
- **Root cause B (fixture drift):** with the full schema now applied, two more pre-existing staleness
  bugs surfaced:
  - `fn_open_position(...)` calls hard-coded `config_version = 1`, but migration 0089 added the
    composite FK `positions(site_id, config_version) → site_game_config_versions(site_id, version)`
    and the default site's config is now at **version 3** (only the current snapshot is retained).
    A brand-new deployment opening at v1 would hit the same FK. Test fix: seed the default site's
    historic v1 snapshot in setup (test-created sites already get a v1 snapshot via the config
    insert trigger). *Note for prod: a fresh single-tenant bootstrap should ensure a v1 snapshot
    exists — tracked separately; not triggered on the live DB because its snapshots pre-date 0085.*
  - `fn_admin_set_user_overrides` was called with `house_edge:0.05` / `win_rate:0.9`, both of which
    migration 0074's `OVERRIDE_FAVORS_PLAYER` guard correctly rejects (better-than-house). Test fix:
    use punitive/valid override values (`win_rate:0.1`), which is what the guard permits.
  - The RLS tests (`e2e_rls_sites`, `e2e_rls_admin_sites`) `set role authenticated` but the shim
    never `grant`s that role SELECT, so they errored on the grant before RLS was ever evaluated
    (they had not run to completion in a long time). Test fix: `grant select on all tables in schema
    public to anon, authenticated` in setup, mirroring Supabase's default-privilege posture so RLS
    is the operative gate (matches the design intent of migrations 0051/0056).
- **Impact:** the DB e2e safety net was effectively inert for 0100+ behaviour. No production impact
  (harness-only), but it masked regressions.
- **Resolution:** all fixes above; the full suite is now **18/18 green** (incl. the new
  `e2e_platform_isolation.py`, 32 scenarios). See docs/38.

## #36 — Daraja B2C payouts failed SILENTLY when initiator/credential unset → withdrawals stranded in `processing` — FIXED (branch `fix/daraja-b2c-fail-loud`)
- **Surfaced by log analysis (post-#34/#35):** the only recurring non-4xx warning was
  `[payments] Daraja credentials not configured … using StubDarajaClient`. That specific line is benign
  (a boot-time ENV fallback; the API immediately loads the real STK creds from `mpesa_config` — "mpesa_config
  loaded from database"). But investigating it exposed a real latent gap.
- **Root cause:** `missingDarajaCredentials` only validates the **STK-4** (consumerKey/secret/shortcode/passkey).
  Live `mpesa_config` has those set, so the API builds a real `HttpDarajaClient` — but `b2c_initiator`
  and `b2c_security_credential` were **EMPTY**. `HttpDarajaClient.b2cPayment` POSTed those empty fields
  straight to Safaricom, which rejects the payout with no usable ConversationID/result callback. Because
  `fn_approve_withdrawal` flips the row to `processing` **before** the API dispatches, a rejected B2C left
  the withdrawal **stuck in `processing` with `conversation_id = NULL`** — the exact stranded-withdrawal
  state the operator had to clear by hand, with nothing in the logs explaining why.
- **Fix (code — surfaces the misconfig; the credentials themselves are operator config):**
  - New `missingB2cCredentials(cfg)` (b2cInitiator, b2cSecurityCredential, b2cResultUrl, b2cTimeoutUrl) —
    B2C readiness is now checked **independently** of STK.
  - `HttpDarajaClient.b2cPayment` now **fails loudly** with `MPESA_B2C_NOT_CONFIGURED:<missing>` *before*
    any network call, instead of POSTing empty creds and getting a silent Safaricom rejection.
  - `makeDarajaClientFromConfig` logs a clear **warning at every build/reload** when STK is ready but B2C
    is not — so the gap shows up proactively in the System logs UI (thanks to #34), not only when a
    withdrawal is attempted.
  - API `DOMAIN_STATUS`: `MPESA_B2C_NOT_CONFIGURED → 503`, so an admin approve returns a clear message.
- **Operator action still required:** set **B2C Initiator Name** + **B2C Security Credential** (Safaricom
  Daraja) in Admin → M-Pesa. STK deposits are unaffected and already live.
- **Tests:** `daraja.b2c.test.ts` (3 — missing-creds detection independent of STK; b2cPayment fails loud
  with no network; STK-only config still yields a usable deposit client with B2C guarded). Suites green:
  engine 314 / API 333; typecheck clean. No migration, no web change.

## #35 — Engine starved the session pooler: one LISTEN connection per brand for a GLOBAL channel — FIXED (branch `fix/engine-config-listen-multiplex`)
- **Surfaced by #34:** with system logs now capturing the engine, `[config] listen-connect [site …]:
  timeout exceeded when trying to connect` was firing ~49×/30min across brands.
- **Root cause:** the engine opened a **dedicated session-pooler LISTEN connection per brand** for the
  per-site config store (`configFor` → `SiteGameConfigStore({ connect })`), each held forever
  (`idleTimeoutMillis: 0`). But `listenPool` `max = 4` and there were **10 active brands** (plus the
  sites-store + deposit-feed LISTENs), so the first few brands permanently occupied the pool and every
  other brand's `connect()` timed out at 10s — forever — leaving those brands on the 15s poll fallback
  and spamming errors. `site_game_config_changed` is a **GLOBAL** channel (payload = the changed
  site_id), so N connections all listening to the same channel was pure waste.
- **Fix:** a `SharedSiteConfigListener` — **ONE** session connection LISTENing on the global channel,
  fanning each notification out to the matching brand's `refresh()` by payload (refresh-all when a
  notification carries no payload). Per-brand stores are now **poll-only** (the 15s fallback stays as a
  safety net), so a dropped shared connection degrades to polling, not silence; the shared listener
  reconnects with backoff. Engine session-LISTEN usage drops from ~12 → 3 (shared-config + sites +
  deposit) regardless of brand count. Also raised `PG_LISTEN_POOL_MAX` default 4 → 6 for reconnect
  headroom. No migration, no per-request/hot-path change.
- **Tests:** `siteconfiglisten.test.ts` (5 unit — one connection for many brands, payload dispatch,
  refresh-all on no payload, unknown-brand no-op, a throwing handler doesn't break others, reconnect
  after error re-arms LISTEN, `stop()` halts reconnects). Suites green: engine 311 / API 333; typecheck
  clean. Verified post-deploy that the timeout errors stop.

---

## #34 — System logs were only half-wired: the WS engine + all direct console.* were never captured — FIXED (branch `fix/system-logs-wire-all`, migration 0129)
- **Report (follow-up to #33):** "map and wire the ENTIRE logs" — #33 only persisted API request/error
  lines; the rest of the system was still invisible.
- **Map (exhaustive, no assumptions):** grepped every `createLogger` and every `console.*` in the
  backend. Findings: (a) the **WS engine has NO structured logger** — its boot, **crash recovery**,
  **daily-seed rotation**, **pool top-ups**, **payments/Daraja/MegaPay**, and WS error reporting are all
  `console.*` → stdout only; (b) the **API had 22 `console.*`** (boot/pool via `makePgPools`) bypassing
  the sink; (c) all these are low-frequency events — no per-tick/per-message hot path — so safe to persist.
- **Fix (both processes, one shared module):** new `systemlog.ts` `makeSystemLogPersister(pool,{app})`
  provides (1) a `loggerSink` for the structured logger and (2) `captureConsole()` that monkey-patches
  `console.{log,info,warn,error,debug}` so EVERY direct console call is persisted too — fully guarded
  (fire-and-forget, re-entrancy-safe, never throws/blocks/recurses). The **API** uses it as its logger
  sink AND captures console (`app='api'`); the **engine** installs `captureConsole()` (`app='engine'`)
  right after its pool is created. Added migration 0129 (`app` column + index, backfilled `'api'`) so
  the UI can filter by process; the read path, `GET /admin/logs`, and the UI gained an `app` filter +
  per-row service badge. Default persist level raised to **`info`** (captures the full request stream +
  every event; `debug`/health excluded); retention prune unchanged.
- **Coverage now:** API requests + errors + money-path (reconcile) + boot console; engine boot + crash
  recovery + seed rotation + pool realtime + platform live-feed + payments (Daraja/MegaPay) + WS errors.
- **Tests:** `systemlog.test.ts` (4 unit: sink promotes columns + drops below-threshold; console capture
  maps level, tags app, serializes Errors, marks `via:console`, restores originals; null-pool no-op;
  idempotent install) + `e2e_system_logs.py` extended to 13 (adds `app` filter). Suites green: engine
  307 / API 333; backend + web typecheck clean; `next build` clean; migrations idempotent.

---

## #33 — System logging was implemented but had no UI (owner couldn't view logs) — FIXED (branch `fix/system-logs-ui`, migration 0128)
- **Report:** "I don't have a UI to see all system logs — it was implemented but the UI was never."
- **State found:** the shared structured logger + per-request logging (docs/36) were implemented, but
  emitted **stdout only** (Fly). There was no queryable store, no API and no UI — distinct from the
  business **Audit log** (`admin_actions`, which already has `/admin/audit`). So system/request/error
  logs could only be seen via `fly logs`.
- **Fix (end-to-end):**
  * **DB (migration 0128):** append-only `system_logs` table (promoted queryable columns + `fields`
    jsonb) with keyset + filter indexes, and `fn_prune_system_logs(keep_days)` for retention.
  * **API sink (`server.ts`):** a logger sink that keeps the stdout line AND persists lines at
    `>= LOG_PERSIST_LEVEL` (default `warn`) to `system_logs` — fire-and-forget, so logging can never
    block/fail a request. Wired as the app + reconcile-sweep logger (so money-path errors persist too),
    plus a periodic retention prune (`LOG_RETENTION_DAYS`, default 30).
  * **Read path:** `GET /admin/logs` — **platform_superadmin only** (system logs are cross-brand
    operational data) — via `AdminService.listSystemLogs` with filters (level, status, q on msg|path,
    requestId, since) + cursor pagination; in-memory harness returns an empty page.
  * **Web:** a **System logs** page (`/admin/logs`) under the owner Platform nav — level filter,
    debounced message/path search, level/status badges, request-id correlation, load-more.
- **Tests:** `e2e_system_logs.py` (11 DB scenarios: newest-first, level/status/requestId/since/text
  filters, keyset paging, retention prune) + `app.admin.test.ts` +1 (owner-only gate: admin/superadmin
  403, anon 401, platform_superadmin 200 page shape). Full suites green: engine 303 / API 333; backend
  + web typecheck clean; `next build` clean (`/admin/logs` builds); migration idempotent.
- **Scope note:** persists API logs (requests, errors, money-path, Mega Pay/Daraja reconcile) — the
  actionable set. Engine (WS) logs can be wired to the same sink as a follow-up. Default persist level
  is `warn` (errors + rejections); set `LOG_PERSIST_LEVEL=info` to capture the full request stream.

## #32 — Approved withdrawals stuck in "processing" forever; no way to mark a payout paid when the B2C callback fails — FIXED (branch `fix/admin-mark-withdrawal-paid`, migration 0127)
- **Report:** approved/paid withdrawals still show "processing"; the admin needs to mark a payment paid
  manually when the rail (e.g. Mega Pay) fails to reflect it, and that must show as paid on the client.
- **Root cause:** the withdrawal lifecycle debits the wallet at request (`fn_create_withdrawal`), flips to
  `processing` on approval (B2C dispatched), and only reaches `success` when the provider's async result
  callback arrives (`fn_complete_withdrawal`). When that callback never lands — a known Mega Pay / Daraja
  failure mode — the row is stranded in `processing`: the money already left the wallet, the player was
  paid out-of-band, but the client shows "processing" indefinitely and there was **no admin action** to
  finalise it (only approve/reject existed). 4 live rows were stuck (invest254 ×2, madolar ×2).
- **Fix:**
  * **DB (migration 0127):** `fn_admin_mark_withdrawal_paid(tx, admin, receipt)` transitions a
    pending/processing withdrawal → `success` with a manual receipt + an `admin_actions` audit row.
    **No wallet change** (money already debited at request). Idempotent on an already-paid row; **refuses**
    a failed/reversed row (`WITHDRAWAL_ALREADY_REVERSED`) so a returned payout is never double-paid.
  * **API:** `POST /admin/withdrawals/:id/mark-paid` — same guards as approve: `requireRole('admin')` +
    superadmin approval-password + `assertTargetSiteInScope` (brand-scoped). Threaded through
    PaymentService/PaymentRepository (pg + in-memory) → fires the same success event as the B2C path so
    the activity feed reflects it.
  * **Web:** a password-gated **"Mark paid"** action in the Withdrawals queue for `pending`/`processing`
    rows; the player's client then shows the withdrawal as paid (reads the same tx status).
- **Tests:** `e2e_admin_mark_withdrawal_paid.py` (17 DB scenarios: processing→paid with wallet unchanged,
  idempotent, pending→paid, reversed refused, unknown tx, audit row) + `app.approvalgate.e2e.test.ts` +4
  (password gate, processing→success + idempotent, brand-scope, reversed→409). Full suites green:
  engine 303 / API 332; backend + web typecheck clean; `next build` clean; migration idempotent.
- **Note:** the 4 currently-stuck rows are left for the operator to mark paid (or reject) per-row via the
  new control — only the operator knows whether each recipient was actually paid out-of-band.

## #31 — A soft-DELETED same-phone account shadowed a marketer's login; @jake locked out of the mpesa app — FIXED (branch `fix/marketer-login-deleted-shadow`)
- **Report:** @jake (marketer) still could not log into the mpesa app after the #30 PIN fix.
- **Investigation (live data, no guessing):** jake has 5 same-phone (`0113488568`) accounts across brands,
  oldest-first: **`@dave` player invest254 `status=deleted` (has password)**, `@jake` marketer safitraders
  active, `@boyz` tamutraders banned, `@jake` madolar player active, `@boyz` 33traders active. His marketer
  wallet is on safitraders (active). The app's non-PIN path is `login-web` (password) → `auth.login({anyBrand:true})`.
- **Root cause:** `AuthService.login` built the candidate list oldest-first, **broke on the FIRST password
  match, then rejected it if `deleted`**. Since jake reuses one password, the first match was his OLDEST
  account — the soft-deleted `@dave` — so login threw `INVALID_CREDENTIALS` and never reached his active
  safitraders marketer account. A soft-deleted account was **shadowing** a valid same-phone account in the
  cross-brand (marketer-app) path. (Not the default-marketer bug — verified independent code paths.)
- **Fix (`apps/engine/src/authservice.ts`):** SKIP `deleted` candidates during password matching, so a
  soft-deleted account can never shadow a valid same-phone account; keep the hard "deleted can't sign in"
  rule (a deleted-ONLY phone still 401s) and constant-time behaviour (a dummy verify when every candidate
  was skipped). Single-account (normal per-brand web) login is unchanged. Code-only (no migration); ships
  on the next Fly deploy.
- **Ripple checked:** callers of `auth.login` are the per-brand web login (single candidate — unchanged)
  and the marketer `login-web` (`anyBrand` — fixed). After the fix jake resolves via ANY non-deleted match
  (his safitraders marketer directly, or a player/banned account → `profileByPhone` any-brand fallback →
  safitraders wallet). Combined with #30 (PIN sig-9) and his now-present marketer PIN, BOTH app login paths
  work. If a marketer's password matches ONLY a deleted account, that is a password-reset case, not this bug.
- **Tests:** `app.marketers.webauth.test.ts` +2 — the deleted-shadow scenario now logs in (was 401), and a
  deleted-ONLY phone still 401s. Full suites green: shared 219 / engine 303 / API 328; typecheck clean.

---

## #30 — Marketer PIN login (mpesa_2 quick-login) failed on any non-07 phone format, on every brand — FIXED (branch `fix/marketer-login-phone-sig9`, migration 0126)
- **Report:** "some marketers cannot log into one or both apps" (mpesa_2 / truecaller).
- **Root cause:** `fn_marketer_login` (PIN path, `POST /marketers/auth/login`) matched `marketers.phone =
  v_phone` EXACTLY (btrim only) — the ONE marketer lookup never migrated to the canonical
  `fn_phone_sig9` (right-9-digits) rule that `profileByPhone`, `fn_marketer_game_withdraw`,
  `fn_is_marketer_account` (0086/0100) all use. The apps send the phone exactly as typed
  (mpesa_2 `PinLoginScreen` reuses `AppState.phone` captured at first sign-in), so a marketer who
  entered `+254…`/`254…`/bare `7…` could sign in with a PASSWORD (`login-web` → `profileByPhone`
  normalizes) but then FAILED the PIN quick-login on relaunch (exact match vs stored `07…`), on ANY
  brand. truecaller uses password-only, so it was unaffected — hence "one or both apps".
- **NOT the default-marketer bug:** marketer login resolves the `marketers` wallet + `marketer_credentials`
  PIN / website password — never `profiles.role` or `sites.owner_user_id`. Verified the two are
  independent code paths.
- **Fix (migration 0126, same 3-arg signature — CREATE OR REPLACE, no app/engine change, no deploy
  window):** match candidates AND the failed-attempt throttle on `fn_phone_sig9(phone)=fn_phone_sig9(input)`
  with a length-9 validity guard; PIN verify, per-account lockout, active-status and optional site scope
  unchanged. Fixes both apps for every marketer on every brand with no APK rebuild (server-side).
- **Also confirmed correct (no change needed):** the mpesa_2 "hardcode SITE=33traders on login" commit
  was rightly REVERTED (a single generic build must not name a brand); the apps send no site and the
  server resolves the brand from the credential (`login-web` via `auth.login anyBrand`; PIN via
  `fn_marketer_login` cross-brand). Those server fixes were already live (deployed 2026-09-12).
- **Tests:** `e2e_marketer_login_phone.py` — 14 scenarios (07/254/+254/bare/spaced all resolve;
  wrong-PIN + 5-miss lockout; cross-brand no leakage; site-hint scoping; malformed phone). Idempotent;
  backend typecheck clean. Read-only prod check: all 8 active marketers now match under 254-format entry.

## #29 — Default marketers on brands that lacked a default when deposits happened showed zero stats — FIXED (data backfill)
- **Report:** "the dashboard isn't populating accurate figures — e.g. the 66investors default marketer
  can't see his statistics."
- **Root cause:** `fn_pay_referral_commissions` roots the 25% at the brand's default marketer
  (`sites.owner_user_id`). Brands that had NO default marketer when deposits occurred (66investors,
  tamutraders never assigned; invest254 partially) accrued NO commission, so the (now-assigned) default
  marketer's dashboard read zero — a DATA gap, not a query bug (33traders/invest254/madolar/safitraders
  with defaults at deposit time were accurate).
- **Fix (data):** replayed the idempotent production accrual RPC over the 373 uncredited successful
  deposits. Result (all `accrued`, zero wallet-affecting rows — no depositor had a referrer so the 5%
  player perk never fired): joy +2,157,175¢ (invest254), mark_mumo +577,500¢ (66investors),
  Blessing.21 +50,000¢ (tamutraders). Every brand gap closed to ≤1¢ (float rounding). cpfmarket's 25%
  was already paid to its prior owner, so its new default legitimately starts at 0. Committed inside a
  transaction that asserted wallets untouched and gaps closed. Recurrence is prevented by the default
  now being set on every brand plus the 0104/0124/0125 default-marketer guards.

---

## #28 — Platform owner couldn't manage a brand's default marketer while impersonating it (Issue-1 control unreachable via impersonation) — FIXED (branch `fix/impersonation-default-marketer-scope`, migration 0125)
- **Report:** while impersonating **66investors**, `Make brand default` / `Remove as default` on a
  66investors marketer (`mark_mumo`) failed `SITE_SCOPE_FORBIDDEN` — a *same-brand* action that should
  succeed.
- **Root cause:** `fn_admin_set_site_owner` (0104/0124) was the ONLY RPC that fenced by the ACTOR's own
  `profiles.site_id`. Impersonation mints a token `role='superadmin', site=<brand>` but keeps the
  SUBJECT = the platform owner (for audit). So `p_actor` is the owner (home brand = the platform's own
  site), while the acted-on brand is the impersonated one. The RPC's actor-home check therefore raised
  `SITE_SCOPE_FORBIDDEN` on every make-/clear-default while impersonating any brand other than the
  owner's home — making the admin-panel default-marketer control (Issue 1) unreachable exactly the way
  the operator uses it. The API's own `ensureUserInScope` (token-scoped) had already allowed it; the
  redundant DB actor-home check contradicted the token.
- **Reproduced (read-only local PG, all migrations):** actor home=SITE_A, `fn_admin_set_site_owner(owner,
  'superadmin', <SITE_B marketer>, true)` → `SITE_SCOPE_FORBIDDEN`.
- **Fix (migration 0125, same 4-arg signature — CREATE OR REPLACE, no call-site/engine change, no
  deploy window):** skip the RPC's actor-home fence when the actor's PROFILE role is
  `platform_superadmin` (the platform owner is inherently cross-brand even via an impersonation
  superadmin token). The impersonation fence stays enforced at the API/token layer
  (`assertTargetSiteInScope` on the token's `site` claim). A REAL per-brand admin/superadmin remains
  home-fenced (defence in depth). The RPC still validates active-marketer-on-site for ASSIGN.
- **Tests:** `e2e_default_marketer_lock.py` extended to **35 scenarios** — owner impersonating SITE_B can
  make + clear a SITE_B default (was forbidden); a real SITE_A superadmin still cannot reach SITE_B; owner
  impersonating their home brand still works. Backend typecheck clean; API 326/326; migration idempotent.
  (The API in-memory harness mocks this RPC, so the DB e2e is the authoritative coverage.)

## #27 — Impersonation was invisible: the console showed "OWNER · FULL AUTHORITY" while fenced to one brand, and logout didn't clear the fence — FIXED (branch `fix/impersonation-clarity`)
- **Report:** as the platform owner (`@zrinok`), every write on a `mark_mumo` (brand **66investors**)
  page failed with `SITE_SCOPE_FORBIDDEN`, even after logout + hard refresh.
- **Root cause (NOT a security bug — a clarity/lifecycle bug):** `/platform/sites/:id/impersonate`
  deliberately mints a **brand-scoped `superadmin`** token (`site` = target brand) so the owner acts
  only within that client's brand. That enforcement is correct. But:
  1. **Invisible fence.** `AdminShell` derived its identity from the live `/auth/me` role
     (`platform_superadmin`), so it displayed "invest254 Console · Owner · full authority / ★ System
     owner" *even while impersonating another brand*. The owner couldn't tell the session was fenced,
     so a cross-brand write looked like a broken permission rather than the wrong brand.
  2. **Sticky after logout.** `logout()` cleared the session token but not the impersonation
     sessionStorage (`pp-impersonating-brand` / `pp-platform-return-token`), and `SessionBootstrap`
     deliberately suppresses the token drift-refresh while `isImpersonating()`. So the fence could
     survive a logout, and a stale brand scope leaked into the next view.
  3. **Dead-end nav.** The cross-brand "All brands" (platform) nav stayed visible while impersonating,
     but the brand-scoped token 403s against `/platform/*`.
- **Fix (`fix/impersonation-clarity`):**
  * Extracted the impersonation state machine into a **framework-free core** (`impersonate.core.ts`)
    with strict validation (fail-closed on a corrupt/tampered brand blob or malformed mint result) and
    a new `clearImpersonation()`; `impersonate.ts` is now a thin sessionStorage/session/window wrapper.
  * **Logout and forced-401 now clear the fence** (`useAuthActions.logout`, `SessionBootstrap`) — a
    brand scope can never outlive the session that created it.
  * **AdminShell reflects the fence:** while impersonating it shows "{Brand} Console · Impersonating ·
    superadmin" and a warn "◉ Impersonating {slug}" badge instead of "Owner · full authority / ★ System
    owner", and it hides the cross-brand "All brands" nav (return via the banner's "Exit to platform").
  * **Banner** made unmistakable: "Impersonating {Brand} as superadmin · {domain} · actions are fenced
    to this brand" with a warn-accented Exit.
- **Tests (tested + retested across different brands):**
  * `impersonate.core.test.ts` — 13 pure unit tests: parse/validation, begin/read/end round-trips,
    switching between brands A→B→C, independent round-trips per brand, clear/idempotency, and
    fail-closed on malformed input / null storage.

## #26 — A brand's DEFAULT marketer could be demoted to 'player', stranding it un-removable + dashboard-less — FIXED (branch `fix/default-marketer-role-lock`, migration 0124)
- **Report (Issue 1):** "the admin must be able to remove a default marketer" and "some marketers cannot
  see their dashboard."
- **Evidence (read-only, production):** three brands had a default marketer (`sites.owner_user_id`)
  whose role had been demoted to **`player`**: `1000wins → @claudia`, `cpfmarket → @marketer001`,
  `muchwins → @sheila`. The `admin_actions` audit shows each was promoted to `marketer`, assigned as
  the brand default, then a superadmin ran `user.set_role` → `player` (claudia 2026-09-13, marketer001
  2026-09-14, sheila 2026-09-15). All three still hold active `affiliates` rows and were still being
  credited deposit commission (marketer001 had KES 100 accrued, sheila KES 194.15) — money routed to
  accounts that can no longer open the marketer dashboard.
- **Root cause:** migration 0104 locked *status* changes (ban/suspend) on a brand default
  (`fn_admin_set_user_status` → `DEFAULT_MARKETER_LOCKED`) but **never locked *role* demotion**.
  `fn_admin_set_user_role` freely moved a brand default out of `'marketer'`, producing an invalid
  state the guarded assign RPCs can't even create. That state then wedged two ways:
  1. **Un-removable:** `fn_admin_set_site_owner` validated `role='marketer'` for BOTH the assign AND
     the clear path, so clearing a now-`player` owner raised `OWNER_NOT_MARKETER`; and the admin panel
     hid the whole control because it was gated on `q.data.role === 'marketer'`.
  2. **Dashboard-less:** `/dashboard` (and the marketer HUD) require `role === 'marketer'`, so a
     demoted default is redirected home even though it is, in substance, the brand's earning marketer.
- **Fix (migration 0124 + web):**
  * **DB:** split `fn_admin_set_site_owner` validation — ASSIGN still requires an ACTIVE marketer on
    the actor's own brand; CLEAR now works for ANY current owner (role/status irrelevant) and derives
    the cleared brand from the ownership row itself, so a corrupt default is always removable. Added
    the symmetric **role-demotion lock** to `fn_admin_set_user_role`: a brand default cannot be moved
    out of `'marketer'` until removed/reassigned (`DEFAULT_MARKETER_LOCKED`); setting/keeping
    `'marketer'` and auto-enroll-on-promotion are unchanged.
  * **Web (`admin/users/[id]/view.tsx`):** render the default-marketer control whenever the account
    *is* a brand default (even if its role drifted off `marketer`) so the Remove action is reachable;
    only offer "Make brand default" for an actual marketer; warn on a stale (non-marketer) default;
    and surface a plain-language `DEFAULT_MARKETER_LOCKED` message on the role control ("remove them as
    the brand default first, then change their role").
- **Why this is the once-for-all fix:** the DB RPC is the authoritative production guard (the API and
  in-memory dev mirror sit behind it). GAP 1 makes removal always possible for every current/future
  corrupt row; GAP 2 stops the corruption from ever being re-created. The pre-existing three rows are
  repaired by a separate operator-confirmed data step and are now also removable directly in the panel.
- **Tests:** new `packages/db/_testkit/e2e_default_marketer_lock.py` — 28 adversarial scenarios on a
  real PG17 with ALL 124 migrations (auth gate, assign active-marketer-only, suspended/​player rejects,
  demotion lock for admin+superadmin, keep-marketer allowed, site-scope on clear, removal, re-enable
  after removal, repair of a forged player-owner default, idempotent no-op clear, platform cross-brand
  clear). Full suites green: shared 219, engine 303, API 319; backend + web typecheck clean; web
  `next build` clean. Migration re-applies idempotently.
- **Note:** the DB-e2e harness's `reset_and_migrate()` globs `00*.sql`, which silently stops at 0099
  (misses 0100–0124); the new test uses `[0-9]*.sql`. Pre-existing suites `e2e_platform_console.py` and
  `e2e_affiliate_sites.py` fail on stale test bodies (a removed `min_withdrawal_native` column; a
  `config_version` FK) independent of this change — logged for a follow-up test-maintenance pass.

---

- **Request (operator, Issue 1):** remove the "Demo balance (for showcasing the game)" card from the
  marketer dashboard, then reorganise the dashboard to bank standards — "if we have 50 expenses, do we
  really list all of them? pages? tables?"
- **Change 1 — demo card removed.** Deleted the self-service demo-wallet section (`useMarketerProfile`
  + `useMarketerDemoTopup` usage, `demoWallet`/`demoTopup`/`demoMsg` state and the `topUpDemo` handler)
  from `apps/web/src/components/marketer/MarketerDashboardView.tsx`. **Frontend-only** — the backend
  demo-topup endpoint, hooks (`api.marketerMe`/`api.marketerDemoTopup`), migration 0102 and
  `app.marketers.demotopup.test.ts` are untouched, so nothing else regresses and the capability can be
  re-surfaced elsewhere if ever wanted.
- **Change 2 — bank-standard IA (progressive disclosure).** The four unbounded lists were the real
  defect: **Expenses rendered EVERY row** (`expRows.map` with no cap — the literal "50 expenses" dump),
  while Earnings/Referrals hard-capped at `.slice(0, 8)` with **no way to see the rest** (referrals even
  had cursor pagination available but unused). Replaced them with ONE tabbed **Activity** ledger
  (Earnings · Expenses · Referrals · Advances), each paged at `LEDGER_PAGE_SIZE = 6` with an explicit
  "Showing X-Y of N · page/pages · Prev/Next" pager; referrals additionally drive the real
  `useAffiliateReferrals` cursor via a "Load more" control. The reconciling commission statement was
  promoted to its own summary card (the trust anchor), and the advance REQUEST form kept as an action
  card with its history moved into Activity ▸ Advances. Hero ("Available to withdraw") stays the
  dominant, role-first metric. Grounded in fintech-dashboard research: lead with one metric, disclose
  detail progressively, paginate with explicit indicators (not infinite scroll) on mobile.
- **Latent bug caught (pre-existing):** the removed demo card and (initially) the new tab control used
  the Tailwind class `bg-card`, but **`card` is not a defined colour token** (tailwind.config only
  defines bg/surface/surface-2/border/fg/muted/up/down/accent/accent-fg/brand/warn/info). Evidence: the
  compiled stylesheet contains **zero** `bg-card` rules (`grep -c bg-card .next/static/css/*.css → 0`).
  Impact: any element relying on `bg-card` for its fill silently rendered transparent. Resolution: the
  new Activity tabs use the app's established segmented-control tokens (`bg-accent text-accent-fg
  shadow-sm` for the active tab, matching `WalletModal`); `bg-card` no longer appears anywhere.
- **New pure module + tests:** `apps/web/src/lib/affiliate/paginate.ts` (`pageInfo`, `pageSlice`) is
  total by construction — hostile input (page 0/999, negative/NaN size, empty list) is clamped, never
  thrown, so a transient data shape can't crash the page. Covered by `paginate.test.ts` (10 cases incl.
  a 5,000-iteration fuzz proving the pages tile the list exactly once, in order, with no gaps/overlaps).
- **Verification (E2E, real-life scenarios):** green baseline captured first (`tsc --noEmit` + full
  `next build`), then re-run after the change — both exit 0, `/dashboard` builds. Full web lib suite:
  **52/52 pass** (incl. the 10 new pagination tests), zero regressions. Rendered the redesign against
  the app's actual compiled Tailwind + default dark tokens with mock data at scale (12 earnings, **50
  expenses**, 26 referrals, 3 advances) and screenshotted mobile (400px) + desktop (920px) across every
  tab and page — confirms the demo card is gone, the 50-expense list is paged 6-at-a-time (1/9), and
  layout reflows to a 4-col grid on desktop. No money-path or API changes; the reconciliation ladder
  (earned − expenses − paid − held ⇒ available) is preserved byte-for-byte.

## #24 — Migration 0118 (real-time pool top-up) was NEVER applied to prod, yet the live engine calls it — FIXED (migration 0118 applied + ledger reconciled)
- **Caught while** reconciling the migration ledger during the BUGLOG #23 rollout: the CI `migrations-ledger`
  gate had been RED for 6+ consecutive runs on `main` (i.e. before the #23 merge), flagging 0117–0120 as
  UNRECORDED.
- **Investigation (no assumptions — checked the LIVE DB, not just the files):**
  * 0117 (`fn_pay_referral_commissions` rail-agnostic + `v_owner` root), 0119 (`fn_pool_ensure_day`) and
    0120 (`site_game_config.min_withdrawal_native`) were APPLIED but never `--record`ed in
    `schema_migrations` → recorded them (metadata only, no behaviour change).
  * **0118 (`fn_pool_topup_today`) was genuinely ABSENT from prod.** But the deployed engine calls it on
    every deposit-triggered reallocation (`apps/engine/src/server.ts:265`), and the platform envelope is
    LIVE (`platform_global_config.global_daily_pool_cents = 20,000,000` = KES 200k), so the gate was open.
- **Impact:** each real-time pool reallocation threw `undefined_function` (caught by the engine's
  `onError`, logged, non-fatal), so **intra-day withdrawal-pool top-ups to under-served brands silently
  never happened** (docs/25 §15.1) — the daily distributor's once-a-day budget was the only allocation,
  degrading payout headroom for brands seeing live demand.
- **Verification before applying (rollback-only txn against the real pool row, site 000…001, today):**
  never-clawback (request < current ⇒ unchanged 7,012,995), raise (request > current ⇒ set to request),
  role-gate (non-superadmin ⇒ `NOT_AUTHORIZED`). Confirmed ZERO persistence from the test (amount
  restored, function absent) before the real apply.
- **Resolution:** applied migration 0118 to prod (additive, idempotent, revertible, money-safe by
  construction — only ever raises via `greatest()`), recorded it + 0117/0119/0120/0121 in
  `schema_migrations`. Ledger now reconciles exactly (121 files = 121 rows, 0 problems), so the
  `migrations-ledger` CI gate goes green.
- **Follow-up (DONE — `chore/auto-apply-migrations-on-deploy`):** the root cause was that migrations
  were applied to prod out-of-band, decoupled from recording. Added `scripts/migrate.mts` — an
  idempotent runner that APPLIES each unrecorded migration and RECORDS it in the SAME transaction
  (apply+record atomic ⇒ the ledger physically cannot drift), refuses to touch a CHANGED (edited-after-
  apply) file, and aborts on first failure. Wired into `deploy.yml` as a gate: `verify → migrate →
  deploy`, so prod schema is always current before the new code boots. (A plain `migrations_status
  --record` was rejected: it stamps files as applied WITHOUT running them, which would mask exactly this
  class of gap.) Validated e2e against the live DB (apply / idempotent / CHANGED-abort / FAILED-rollback,
  then cleaned up).

## #23 — Marketer "Net after expenses" didn't reconcile with withdrawable; expense TOTAL summed a capped page — FIXED (branch `fix/marketer-net-after-expense`, migration 0121)
- **Report (operator):** "fix the bug in the calculation of Marketers net after expense."
- **Root cause (three distinct defects, banker's ledger view):** the marketer's money is one ledger —
  `E` = accrued marketer commission, `X` = Σ logged expenses/advances, `P` = paid commission payouts,
  `H` = held (requested/approved) payouts, and the authoritative withdrawable is
  `Available = max(E − X − P − H, 0)` (`fn_commission_balance`, migration 0105). The dashboard broke that ledger in three ways:
  1. **"Net after expenses" = `earned − expenses`** (`MarketerDashboardView.tsx`) ignored `P` and `H`, so
     it overstated the position of any marketer who had been paid. Evidence (prod, read-only): *jake*
     showed **+KES 410** "net" while his real `Available` was **0** (E 850 − X 440 − P 562.50 → floored 0).
  2. **Expense TOTAL summed a limit-capped page**, not all rows. `GET /affiliate/expenses` and
     `GET /admin/affiliate/expenses` returned `totalCents = reduce(items)` where `items` is capped at
     `limit` (default 100), while `fn_commission_balance` nets the FULL SQL sum. Rollback-txn e2e: 150
     expense rows → the page-sum reported **10,000** vs the true **59,000** (a 49,000 undercount) — the
     displayed total silently diverges from what actually reduces the withdrawable.
  3. **`earned` was defined two ways.** `myReferral` computed `earnedCents` as an UNFILTERED sum of all
     the user's `deposit_commissions`, but pulled `held/paid/available` from `fn_commission_balance`
     (accrued-marketer only). For a player (instant 5% `status='paid'` rows) later promoted to marketer,
     "Earned all-time"/"Net after expenses" would include already-paid player commission and diverge
     from `Available`. Latent (0 cases in prod today) but a real correctness defect.
- **Operator direction:** think like a banker; find and fix ALL the miscalculations; no guesswork; test e2e.
- **Resolution (branch `fix/marketer-net-after-expense`):**
  * **Migration 0121:** `fn_marketer_expenses_total(uuid)` — the authoritative full sum, mirroring the
    `ex` term in `fn_commission_balance`. Additive, idempotent, read-only, `service_role`-only.
  * **API:** `MarketerExpensesDeps.total()` (pg + test fake); both expenses endpoints now return
    `totalCents` from the full sum, never the page. `ReferralSummary` gains `marketerEarnedCents`
    (= `fn_commission_balance.earned_cents`) so the marketer balance context uses one consistent `earned`.
  * **Web:** the dashboard's Expenses section is now a **reconciling statement** —
    `Earned → −Expenses (= Net after expenses) → −Paid out → −Pending → = Available to withdraw` — that
    ends on the exact figure the hero/KPI show. "Net after expenses" is kept as a labelled subtotal (now
    on the FULL expense sum) and can no longer mislead because the ladder continues to the true withdrawable.
    `ReferralCommissionsCard` shows `marketerEarnedCents` for marketers (players keep `earnedCents`).
- **Verification:** typecheck clean; 880/880 unit tests pass (incl. a new regression test proving
  `totalCents` is the full sum with `limit` < row count). Rollback-only DB e2e against the LIVE functions:
  for every marketer `max(E−X−P−H,0) == fn_commission_balance.available` AND `fn_marketer_expenses_total == SUM(expenses)`; the 150-row divergence proof above; ROLLBACK verified (function absent post-rollback, no rows written).
- **Known follow-up (not changed here — money-flow gating needs sign-off):** `fn_approve_commission_payout`
  / `fn_mark_commission_payout_paid` don't re-validate the payout against a balance reduced by an expense
  logged AFTER the request. The hold is locked at request time, so an expense added between request and
  pay is only recovered from FUTURE commission (the ledger stays floored ≥ 0, never negative). Payouts are
  human-gated (admin approval + superadmin password), so exposure is low. Recommend a re-check at
  approve-time as a separate, reviewed change.

## #22 — Deposit page + API ignored the `mpesa` gateway switch (Daraja always shown) — FIXED (branch `fix/deposit-gateway-switch-gating`)
- **Evidence:** in the first cut of the gateway switches (0116), `DepositPanel` rendered the "STK Push"
  and "Pay Bill" (Daraja) tabs **unconditionally**, and the API `/deposits` + `/deposits/paybill/claim`
  routes had no provider check. So switching the `mpesa` provider **off** (superadmin, e.g. because
  Pay Bill was faulty) still left Daraja visible and usable — the switch only governed Mega Pay.
- **Impact:** a superadmin who disabled M-Pesa still exposed the broken Daraja/Pay Bill rail to real
  players. Caught immediately after go-live (the operator had turned M-Pesa off + Mega Pay on).
- **Resolution:** the `mpesa` provider now governs BOTH Daraja rails. `DepositPanel` renders STK Push +
  Pay Bill only when `mpesa` is effective-enabled and Mega Pay only when `megapay` is (loading + empty
  states handled; single-method hides the tab bar). Server-side, `/deposits` and `/deposits/paybill/claim`
  refuse with `PROVIDER_DISABLED` when `mpesa` is off — mirroring the `/deposits/megapay` gate. New test
  in `app.megapay.test.ts` locks it. Fail-open (M-Pesa) still applies if the provider lookup errors.

---

## #21 — Deposit `ABOVE_MAX` mapped to HTTP 500 instead of 400 — FIXED (branch `feat/megapay-gateway`)
- **Evidence:** `PaymentService.initiateDeposit` throws `ABOVE_MAX` when a deposit exceeds the
  platform-global max single deposit (migration 0099), but `DOMAIN_STATUS` in `apps/api/src/app.payments.ts`
  had no entry for `ABOVE_MAX`, so the router mapped it to a generic **500 Internal Server Error**.
- **Root cause:** the max-deposit enforcement (0099) added the `ABOVE_MAX` throw but the HTTP error map
  was not updated, so a legitimate client-side validation failure surfaced as a server fault.
- **Impact:** a player entering an over-cap amount got a 500 (looks like an outage / no actionable
  message) instead of a clean 400 "amount exceeds the maximum". Pre-existing; low severity, no money effect.
- **Resolution:** added `ABOVE_MAX: 400` (plus the new Mega Pay codes `PROVIDER_NOT_FOUND`,
  `PROVIDER_DISABLED`, `MEGAPAY_NOT_CONFIGURED` 503, `MEGAPAY_INITIATE_REJECTED` 502,
  `MEGAPAY_VERIFY_PENDING` 409) to `DOMAIN_STATUS`. Covered by the deposit-floor/junk test in
  `app.megapay.test.ts`.

---

## #20 — Multipliers were pool-blind, tick-blind, transport-less and crash-unsafe — FIXED (branch `feat/issue1-multipliers-live`)
- **Evidence:** the Phase-2 multiplier engine methods existed but (a) TP/SL/stop-out/DC were never
  evaluated by any loop (the settle methods were dead code nothing called), (b) no WS/REST transport
  reached them, (c) P/L priced off the classic BTC/KES curve instead of the instrument the player was
  viewing, (d) open contracts lived only in memory (a restart stranded the debited stake), and
  (e) the pool fund did not govern them — an uncapped, player-timed cash-out book (manual close at
  any green tick) is even more loss-exposed than fair digits.
- **Resolution (same central algorithm as digits/rise-fall):**
  * Instrument feed pricing + per-tick evaluation via `tickMultipliers` (driven by the per-(site,
    instrument) streamer): TP / SL / stop-out / deal-cancellation auto-close; `mult_update` /
    `mult_closed` pushed to owners; `open_multiplier` / `close_multiplier` messages.
  * **Pool mode = timed bracket contract** decided at open with `decideReserveFixed` (candidate
    payout = stake + TP, default TP = +100% of stake): reserve → seeded 20–60s reversing path →
    auto-settle at exactly +TP (commit) or stop-out at −stake. SL/DC/manual close unavailable in
    pool mode (decision B). ONE shared budget + turnover + RTP ceiling across all three surfaces.
  * Crash recovery: pool contracts settle/re-arm from the persisted decision; statistical ones
    re-arm from `positions.contract`; boot re-arms instrument streamers so recovered contracts keep
    evaluating with zero clients connected.
  * Web `MultipliersPanel` trades real server-acked contracts (simulation removed).
- **Impact:** multiplier losses are hard-capped by the same central pool; realized RTP ≤
  1 − house_edge at every volume. Tests: full suite **813/813** (new: 6 statistical feed scenarios,
  6 pool scenarios incl. shared-budget + double-crash recovery, 2 WS e2e); typecheck clean.

## #19 — Digits shipped POOL-BLIND: a fair 5%-edge book with no budget cap (the exact "huge losses" failure mode) — FIXED (branch `feat/issue1-digits-live`)
- **Report (operator):** before merging digits, apply the pool-fund algorithm — "all clients have a
  central control point of configurations… I had tested with the other algorithm, but made huge losses."
- **Evidence / risk analysis:** the first digits increment settled EVERY trade on the provably-fair
  uniform digit at factor 0.95 (5% edge), ignoring `pool_mode` entirely. That book is the exact shape
  that loses money in practice:
  * **Variance vs a thin edge:** even/odd at 1.9× and 5% edge swings wildly; on thin-volume days the
    house is underwater a large fraction of days (the same hole docs/25 §14 closed for rise/fall).
  * **Martingale extraction:** the built-in AUTO bot doubles on loss — against an uncapped fair book a
    lucky streak cashes the whole float; nothing bounded daily payouts.
  * **No central control:** daily pools, dynamic per-client distribution, `pool_mode`, and the
    `house_edge` dial governed rise/fall only; digits bypassed all of it.
- **Root cause:** digits were wired to the statistical engine only; the PoolController (docs/25 — the
  managed-book brain with the hard cash cap + RTP-budget ceiling that already protects rise/fall) was
  never consulted for contracts.
- **Resolution (exact algorithm, fixed-odds adaptation):**
  * `decidePoolOutcomeFixed` (shared) + `decideReserveFixed` (controller): the SAME brain — propensity
    with base p = targetRtp/m (edge invariant E[RTP] ≤ 1 − house_edge), pool cash fuse, per-player
    no-scoop share, hard ceiling `paid + reserved ≤ ⌊targetRtp × turnover⌋`, near-miss lever,
    reserve→commit/release atomicity, persisted `position_decision` — with one fixed-odds rule: a win
    pays exactly the contract return or the trade loses (no shrunk wins).
  * `game.ts` routes digits exactly like rise/fall: pool path for non-marketers in pool-mode brands;
    provably-fair statistical path for pool-off brands and marketers/demo. One open digit contract per
    (user, instrument). Displayed digit is decision-consistent (seeded from the decision) and the
    owner's settle-index tick is overridden to match (chart == result).
  * **Shared central budget:** digits + rise/fall reserve from the SAME `withdrawal_pool` row,
    turnover, and ledger per brand — so per-client pools, the dynamic all-client distribution
    (docs/25 §15), and `pool_mode`/`house_edge` govern both surfaces with zero extra configuration.
  * Recovery: pool-decided digit contracts recover from the stored decision (commit on win),
    statistical ones from the seed. Idempotent.
- **Operational note (caught by test):** the 15% no-scoop share must exceed the largest fixed payout
  or players can never win — size a client's daily pool ≥ ~7× the largest digit payout (docs/34).
- **Impact:** digit losses are now hard-capped by the same central pool that already protects
  rise/fall; realized digit RTP ≤ 1 − house_edge at every volume. Tests: full suite **804/804**
  (new: 7 fixed-odds brain invariants, 9 engine pool-digit scenarios incl. combined rise/fall+digits
  budget + crash recovery, 1 WS pool-mode e2e); `tsc -b` + web `tsc` clean.

---

## #18 — Deriv-style DIGIT contracts were unreachable AND mispriced (would return 0.5× a "win") — FIXED (branch `feat/issue1-digits-live`)
- **Report (Issue 1):** the Phase-2 Deriv-style digits bot was built bottom-up (shared math + DB
  `fn_open_contract` + engine methods + a full web screen) but **no client could place a real digit
  contract**, and the web screen self-labelled "Preview mode · no real-money movement yet".
- **Evidence:**
  * WS transport (`multiengine.ts`) handled only `auth`/`open_position`/`sell`/`ping` — **no
    `open_digit`/instrument messages**, so `game.ts.openDigitContract()` was dead code (only tests
    reached it). No REST contract endpoints either.
  * The web `DigitsTradeScreen` generated its OWN client-side GBM prices (`useInstrument`) and settled
    locally — decoupled from any server, so outcomes were neither authoritative nor provably fair.
  * **Latent money bug:** `settleDigitContract` priced payouts with `factor = 1 − houseEdge`. But
    `houseEdge = 0.75` (the rise/fall crash-game economics) ⇒ an even/odd **win** would return
    `round(stake × 0.25 / 0.5) = 0.5× stake` — i.e. "winning" LOST half the stake. Unplayable and
    grossly unfair had it ever been wired.
  * Digit outcomes derived from `lastDigit(curve.rate(t))` of the single shared curve — a smooth,
    green-biased `tanh` curve whose last pip is **not uniform**, so even/odd ≠ 0.5 (edge drift).
  * Open digit contracts lived only in an in-memory map — a restart between open and settle would
    **strand a debited stake** with no recovery.
- **Root cause:** the feature was intentionally "demo-first / unwired" (per commit messages and
  migration 0113's header) and never had a transport, an authoritative price source, a digit-specific
  payout knob, or crash recovery.
- **Resolution (server-authoritative, provably fair, per-instrument):**
  * **Per-instrument seeded feed** (`packages/shared/instrumentfeed.ts`): extends the daily-seed model
    to each Deriv Volatility Index (Vol 10–250, 1s/2s). The settling last digit is
    `HMAC(daySeed, "dg:<instrument>:<index>") mod 10` — **exactly uniform**, so the payout factor IS
    the edge with no distributional drift; the displayed quote's last pip equals that digit
    ("chart digit == settled digit"). Pure & recomputable ⇒ provably fair + trivially recoverable.
  * **Digit payout factor** (`config.ts` `digitPayoutFactor`, default **0.95 = 5% edge**), independent
    of the rise/fall `houseEdge`. Fixes the 0.5× bug; operators can set 0.976 to mirror Deriv's
    on-screen "95.2% payout".
  * **WS transport** (`multiengine.ts`): `subscribe_instrument` → authoritative `inst_history` +
    live `inst_tick`; `open_digit` → `digit_opened` + balance; a per-(site,instrument) streamer
    settles every due contract (`settleDueDigits`) and fans `digit_settled` to owners. Unknown
    instrument ids are rejected (no spoofing).
  * **Crash recovery** (`recovery.ts`): open `kind='digit'` positions re-settle deterministically from
    the committed `{instrument, settleIndex}` in `positions.contract`, idempotently (no double credit).
  * **Web** (`GameSocketProvider` + `DigitsTradeScreen`): the same single socket now streams the
    instrument feed and places REAL contracts; local simulation removed. UI unchanged (Deriv layout).
- **Impact:** digits are live end-to-end, server-authoritative, provably fair (uniform), correctly
  priced, and crash-safe. Tests: **full suite 787/787**; `tsc -b` + web `tsc` clean. New coverage:
  shared feed (determinism, exact uniformity Monte-Carlo, quote↔digit invariant, edge), engine digit
  contracts, WS e2e (subscribe→stream→open→settle), and crash recovery. Multipliers are the next
  increment (tick-loop TP/SL/stop-out) and remain preview for now.

## #17 — Two divergent "marketer" systems + no way to delete; a "player" (stanley) was silently a demo account — FIXED (migration 0110, branch `feat/delete-and-marketer-consolidation`)
- **Report:** stanley is a player, but his withdrawals took the demo/instant rail (no bot alert). Also
  two UIs "manage a marketer" (Users → upgrade-to-marketer role; Marketer-finance → add-marketer demo),
  and there was no button to delete a marketer/user/admin.
- **Root cause (two concepts, one name):** `role='marketer'` (affiliate, real 25% commission via
  `affiliates`/`commission_payouts`) is INDEPENDENT of the DEMO cohort, which is defined by
  `fn_is_marketer_account` = a phone match in the `marketers` table (per docs/29). stanley (`role=player`)
  had a `marketers` row on his phone, so the money layer treated him as demo. `fn_is_marketer_account`
  ignores the marketers row's status, so even a `disabled` marketers row keeps a person demo — only
  DELETING the row un-demos them. Data confirmed the drift: 28 demo rows = 20 linked + 8 phantom; of
  the linked, 10 are `role=marketer` and 10 are `role=player` (demo-only, like stanley); plus 4
  affiliate-only. No delete function existed anywhere.
- **FK reality:** `marketers` FKs all CASCADE (safe hard delete). `profiles` FKs are mostly NO ACTION
  (transactions/ledger/positions/referrals/commissions/audit) → a real user/admin CANNOT be hard-deleted
  without destroying the financial audit trail.
- **Resolution:**
  * **Delete demo marketer (hard):** `POST /admin/marketers/:id/delete` → `DELETE FROM marketers`
    (cascades wallet/ledger/withdrawals/credentials), brand-scoped. Removes demo status.
  * **Delete user/admin (soft):** migration 0110 adds status `'deleted'` + `fn_admin_delete_user`
    (no-self, superadmin-protected, admin-only-by-superadmin, default-marketer-locked, idempotent);
    sets `sessions_valid_after=now()`. `POST /admin/users/:id/delete`. Login now blocks `'deleted'`
    accounts (anti-enumeration); lists hide them; money layer already rejects non-active.
  * **Consolidation:** the Marketer & affiliate finance hub is the single place to add/remove a demo
    marketer (delete in the Manage modal) and cross-links to the linked website account for the
    affiliate role; the Users page keeps the role field + deep-links to the hub.
  * **stanley fixed in production:** deleted his `marketers` row → `fn_is_marketer_account` True→False;
    profile stays player/active, real+demo balances intact. He now withdraws on the real rail.
- **Impact:** the demo/real ambiguity is resolvable from the UI; deleting is safe (cascade) or
  history-preserving (soft). Tests: full suite 728/728; `tsc -b` + web `tsc` clean; migration 0110 +
  the stanley delete verified against the real schema.

## #16 — Real-money vs "funny money" were entangled on the approval channel + approvals had no password — FIXED (branch `feat/telegram-approvals-issue1`, migration 0109)
- **Report (Issue 1):** improve Telegram payout alerts (thorough content, bank-grade look, no emojis),
  organise them (waiting/approved/rejected), reduce Approve/Reject to immediate actions, and require the
  superadmin password to approve — in BOTH the dashboard and the Telegram bot.
- **Bug caught (money routing):** migration 0108 had gated the **demo/"funny money"** marketer game→wallet
  transfer (`fn_marketer_game_withdraw`, `transactions` provider=`internal`) behind admin approval and
  routed it to the alert channel. Evidence: the only two `pending` withdrawals in production were
  `provider='internal'` demo transfers ("stanley", a phone-matched demo account). Real player M-Pesa
  withdrawals already alerted; real marketer **commission** payouts (`commission_payouts`) did **not**
  alert at all. So the channel carried the wrong money: fake money was gated/notified, one real-money
  flow was silent.
- **Bug caught (no approval proof):** all four approve surfaces (dashboard, Telegram inline button,
  email magic-link, web-push) executed on role/allowlist alone — **no password**. Approving real M-Pesa
  payouts required no second factor.
- **Resolution:**
  * **Migration 0109** restores the pre-0108 **instant** `fn_marketer_game_withdraw` (demo money credits
    the marketer wallet immediately, `success`, never on the channel), leaves the shared
    `fn_approve_withdrawal`/`fn_reject_withdrawal` intact for the real M-Pesa rail, and **backfills** the
    internal rows 0108 left `pending`. Validated on the real schema inside a rolled-back transaction.
  * **Superadmin password gate** on Approve across **every** surface (`requireApprovalPassword` +
    `verifyApprovalPassword`, scrypt against an active `platform_superadmin`). Reject stays immediate.
    Telegram uses a stateless force-reply flow that deletes the password message after use.
  * **Marketer commission** payouts now alert (Telegram + email); bot Approve = approve **+ mark-paid**.
  * **Content**: enriched, emoji-free, bank-grade Telegram + email templates (amount, client, user type,
    destination, time, reference); status topics optional.
- **Impact:** real money (player withdrawals + marketer commission) is what needs approval and now
  carries a password; demo money is instant and off the channel. No double-spend risk (demo hold/credit
  is atomic). Full suite green (724/724); `tsc -b` + web `tsc` clean. See docs/33.
- **Deploy note:** apply migration 0109 **before** deploying the API (the code assumes instant demo).

## #14 — Marketer expenses/advances never reached the dashboard; didn't affect withdrawable — FIXED (migration 0105)
- **Report:** expenses/advances logged in admin ("Marketer expenses") weren't reflected on the
  marketer's dashboard, and the net (withdrawable) math looked wrong.
- **Root cause (two identity systems):** a marketer exists as BOTH a website affiliate (`profiles`,
  role='marketer' — where commissions, `/dashboard` and its Expenses/Net section live) AND a
  marketer-APP identity (`marketer_profiles`/`marketers` — the simulated M-Pesa wallet). Same
  phone/brand, **different ids**. Migration 0068 defines `marketer_expenses.marketer_user_id` as a
  `profiles.id`, and the only marketer-facing reader (`GET /affiliate/expenses`, `fn_commission_balance`)
  keys on `profiles.id`. But the marketer-finance **Expenses** tab listed `marketer_profiles` and logged
  with `marketer_profiles.id`, so every logged expense was stored under an id **no dashboard reads**.
- **Evidence (production):** all logged expense rows were keyed to `marketer_profiles.id` (e.g. KES 450
  "Commission Tests" under *Mohan Abdul* `7965afa2…`, whose website account is *Mohane* `0cb63be4…`).
  Coverage: 9 marketer-app accounts map to a website marketer, 17 don't (no ambiguous matches).
- **Operator decision:** ALL logged expenses reduce withdrawable (`Available = earned − held − paid −
  expenses`, floored at 0).
- **Resolution (branch `feat/marketer-expenses-affiliate-key`, migration 0105 + API + web):**
  * **0105:** (a) `fn_commission_balance` now subtracts total logged expenses from `available_cents`
    (floored at 0); since the payout RPC reads `available_cents`, payouts are auto-capped at the net —
    timing-safe, never double-counts. (b) Re-keys existing mis-keyed expense rows from
    `marketer_profiles.id` → the matching affiliate `profiles.id` (`fn_phone_sig9` + same site +
    role='marketer', oldest); app-only accounts with no website marketer are left untouched. Idempotent.
  * **API:** the marketers list (`marketers.pg.ts`) now resolves each marketer-app row's linked affiliate
    `profiles.id` (`affiliate_user_id`) so expenses can be keyed correctly.
  * **Web:** the marketer-finance **Expenses** tab logs/reads by `affiliate_user_id`; app accounts with no
    website marketer are disabled ("no website account"). The `/dashboard` needed **no** change — it now
    populates automatically and `Available to withdraw` is net of expenses.
- **Verification:** rolled-back live e2e (re-key correctness + netted balances: *Mohane* KES 50 earned −
  KES 450 expenses → available 0; a +KES 50 expense on *moha* drops available by exactly that; app-only
  advance left untouched); 0105 applied to production and re-checked live; ledger reconciled (105/105);
  backend+web typecheck clean; full suite 673/673.

## #13 — Banned marketer stayed a brand's earning default; no admin-panel way to reassign — FIXED (migration 0104)
- **Report (operator):** *Mohane* (the only ACTIVE marketer on **madolar**) was still not the brand
  default; the "Make brand default" control couldn't be found where marketers are actually managed.
- **Evidence (read-only, production):** madolar had `sites.owner_user_id = moha`, but **moha and Mohan
  were both `banned`** and *Mohane* was the lone `active` marketer — yet a **banned** marketer remained
  the brand default and kept accruing 25% of every deposit. The only assignment UI lived in the
  **Platform Console** (`/platform`, platform_superadmin), not the **Admin panel** (`/admin/users`)
  operators use; and nothing prevented a default marketer from being banned or stopped a banned user
  from being (or staying) the default.
- **Root causes:** (1) surface mismatch — the control was platform-only; (2) `fn_platform_set_site_owner`
  validated role + site but **not status**, so a banned/suspended marketer could be set/left as default;
  (3) `fn_admin_set_user_status` had **no guard** against banning/suspending the current default.
- **Immediate data fix:** reassigned madolar's default from banned *moha* → active *Mohane*
  (`fn_platform_set_site_owner`, audited). Future deposits now credit Mohane 25%. (Historical
  commissions already paid to *moha* were left as-is.)
- **Resolution (branch `feat/admin-default-marketer-guards`, migration 0104 + API + web):**
  * **0104:** (a) `fn_platform_set_site_owner` now rejects a non-active marketer (`OWNER_NOT_ACTIVE`);
    (b) new **site-scoped** `fn_admin_set_site_owner(actor, role, marketer, make_default)` lets a brand
    `admin`/`superadmin` set/clear THEIR OWN brand's default (site derived from the marketer;
    `SITE_SCOPE_FORBIDDEN` off-brand; active-marketer enforced); (c) `fn_admin_set_user_status` blocks
    banning/suspending the current default (`DEFAULT_MARKETER_LOCKED`) — reassign first (per operator
    choice: **block**). Reactivating is always allowed.
  * **API:** `POST /admin/marketers/:id/make-default` and `/clear-default` (admin-gated, brand-scope
    enforced), routed via `PlatformRepository.setDefaultMarketer`. `AdminUserDetail` gains
    `isBrandDefaultMarketer`.
  * **Web:** `/admin/users/:id` shows a **"Make brand default" / "Remove as default"** control for
    marketers with a ★ current-default badge — where operators already manage users.
- **Verification:** rolled-back live e2e (13 scenarios: every guard + valid set/clear) against the real
  schema; 0104 applied to production and re-checked live (ban-of-default → `DEFAULT_MARKETER_LOCKED`).
  Typecheck clean (backend + web); full suite 673/673 (added an admin route-wiring/gating test).

## #12 — "Mohane's earnings not populating" — NOT A BUG (by design); default-marketer assignment made a first-class button + docs corrected
- **Report:** marketer *Mohane*'s dashboard showed no earnings; suspected a regression of #11.
- **Investigation (read-only, production):** *Mohane* (`0cb63be4…`, role `marketer`, brand **madolar**
  `776fd02b…`) has **0** `deposit_commissions`, **0** balance (`fn_commission_balance`), **0** direct
  referrals (`profiles.referred_by = Mohane` is empty), **0** clicks on her code `HYJJJQW2`. The
  dashboard (`GET /me/referral` → `sum(deposit_commissions.commission_amount)`) is therefore faithfully
  reporting zero.
- **Why zero is correct:** madolar's **default marketer** is *moha* (`sites.owner_user_id = a765af32…`).
  Verified the live model works: **78/78** successful M-Pesa deposits (KES 25,286.00) each generated a
  commission to *moha* at rate `0.25`, totalling KES 6,321.50 = **exactly 25%** — even though **all 118
  madolar players have `referred_by = NULL`**. So "default marketer earns 25% of every deposit,
  regardless of referral link" is already implemented and correct (`fn_pay_referral_commissions`,
  0103, invoked by `fn_complete_deposit`). *Mohane* is a **non-default** sub-marketer with no attributed
  deposits, so she correctly earns nothing.
- **Operator decision:** keep the differential-split model (every deposit still totals 25%, default
  marketer always at the root — **Model B**, no commission-math change), AND make assigning a brand's
  default marketer a first-class action.
- **Root cause of the confusion:** stale docs — `README.md` still described a legacy "20% of GGR / net
  losses" affiliate model, contradicting the live 25%-of-deposits model.
- **Resolution (branch `feat/set-default-marketer`, UI + docs only — no schema/money-path change):**
  * `apps/web/.../platform/ClientDetail.tsx`: added a **"Make brand default"** button (and
    **"Remove as default"**) in the per-user management panel, plus a **★ default** badge in the user
    table. Gated on `role = 'marketer'` client-side (backend `fn_platform_set_site_owner` already
    enforces marketer-on-same-brand + `platform_superadmin`, audited). This fixes a real gap: the
    pre-existing top-of-list selector only listed marketers from the first 50 loaded rows, so a marketer
    deeper in the list could not be selected; the search-then-select button reaches **any** marketer.
  * Docs: `README.md` (both 20% references corrected to the 25%-of-deposits hierarchical model), `docs/09`
    §3 (added "a brand always credits its default marketer" clarification + how to assign the default
    marketer), and this entry.
- **Verification:** rolled-back live e2e of `fn_platform_set_site_owner` — NOT_AUTHORIZED /
  SITE_NOT_FOUND / OWNER_NOT_FOUND / OWNER_NOT_MARKETER / OWNER_WRONG_SITE all fire; valid set
  (Mohane→madolar default) and clear-to-NULL both succeed; transaction rolled back (production
  untouched). Web typecheck clean; platform+referral+affiliate suites green (16/16).

## #1 — Bonus subsystem was dormant in the live money RPCs — FIXED (issue 1 / migration 0094)
- **What:** `bonus_balance` was frozen platform-wide — it could never be staked, wagered, or converted.
- **Evidence:** Live `fn_open_position` (10-arg) and `fn_settle_position` only moved `real`/`demo`
  balances; the `bonuses` table was empty across all 9 brands.
- **Root cause:** the original 0037 bonus mechanics were dropped when the RPCs were rewritten for
  site-scoping (0047) and demo isolation (0084). Deposit-bonus *granting* was also removed at 0077/0078.
- **Impact:** any credit to `bonus_balance` would have been permanently unusable and non-withdrawable.
- **Resolution:** migration 0094 restores bonus-first staking, wagering accrual, and FIFO conversion in
  the site-scoped/demo-aware RPCs (additive; verified no-op for existing zero-bonus accounts). See docs/31.

## #2 — DepositForm advertised a deposit bonus the backend never grants — FIXED (issue 1)
- **What:** the deposit screen showed a live "+KES X bonus (50%/25%/15%)… credited instantly as bonus
  balance" preview, but `fn_complete_deposit` (0078) grants no deposit bonus.
- **Resolution (per direction "remove any deposit-bonus apart from the one we just implemented"):**
  removed the DepositForm preview + `bonusPctForDeposit` import; deleted the shared deposit-tier module
  (`packages/shared/src/bonus.ts`, its `./bonus` package export, the engagement re-export, and its
  tests); and dropped the orphaned `fn_deposit_bonus_pct` in migration 0094. The **only** bonus in the
  system is now the sign-up welcome bonus. (Legacy `bonus_config.tiers/wagering_x` columns are left
  inert.)

## #3 — Admin "day" finance report is timezone-fragile (fails 00:00–03:00 EAT) — FIXED (issue 1 / global-config)
- **What:** `app.admin.isolation.e2e.test.ts` → "finance reports (daily/day/users) are brand-scoped"
  fails: `day report: brand A only` expects 40000, gets 0.
- **Evidence:** Reproduced on a clean `main` (pre-existing; independent of issue 1). The test derives
  `today` via `Africa/Nairobi` (`toLocaleDateString('en-CA', { timeZone: 'Africa/Nairobi' })`) while the
  deposit rows are grouped by their stored (UTC) date. When the run happens in the window where the
  Nairobi calendar date is already ahead of UTC (00:00–03:00 EAT), the requested day and the stored day
  disagree and the report returns 0.
- **Impact:** the `/admin/reports/day` aggregation and/or the test are not timezone-consistent; the
  report can under-count near the UTC/EAT day boundary. Test is flaky by wall-clock (green during Nairobi
  daytime).
- **Refined root cause (this fix):** the *production* report (`PgAdminRepo.reportDay`, apps/engine/src/admin.ts)
  was already correct — it groups by `(created_at at time zone 'Africa/Nairobi')::date`. The defect was in
  the **in-memory test harness** helper `dayOfMs` (apps/engine/src/admin.ts:521), which used
  `toISOString().slice(0,10)` (UTC). The harness therefore bucketed cash facts under the UTC day while the
  test (and production) use the EAT day — diverging only in the 00:00–03:00 EAT window.
- **Resolution:** `dayOfMs` now returns the EAT calendar date
  (`toLocaleDateString('en-CA', { timeZone: 'Africa/Nairobi' })`), matching production SQL and the callers'
  EAT `today`. **No production financial-reporting behaviour changed** (only the harness), so the prior
  concern about touching a live report does not apply. Baseline test suite is now fully green (610/610),
  and the finance-isolation e2e is deterministic regardless of wall-clock.
- **Follow-on:** two `app.admin.test.ts` report tests computed their expected day in UTC
  (`toISOString().slice(0,10)`) and were the mirror of the isolation test (they only passed during
  Nairobi daytime). Aligned both to the EAT calendar date so ALL day-report tests now agree with the
  production EAT boundary and each other.

## #4 — Phone-only password reset is account takeover for admins/superadmins — FIXED (issue 2 / migration 0097)
- **What:** `POST /api/v1/auth/password/reset` sets a new password from phone + new password alone
  (no possession proof), gated only by `ALLOW_UNVERIFIED_PASSWORD_RESET`. For a privileged account
  (admin / superadmin / platform_superadmin) anyone who knows the phone number could seize the back
  office.
- **Evidence:** `AuthService.resetPassword` had no second factor for privileged roles; the only reset
  path is that public endpoint (no admin-panel reset exists). Production roles are player/marketer/
  admin/platform_superadmin — note there is NO literal `superadmin`, so the real top account is
  `platform_superadmin` and had to be included in the privileged set.
- **Impact:** full account takeover of any admin whose phone number is known. `ALLOW_UNVERIFIED_PASSWORD_RESET`
  IS set as a Fly secret on `invest254-api` (confirmed via `fly secrets list`; value hidden but presence
  implies enabled), so this was very likely LIVE-exploitable before the fix. (An earlier partial GraphQL
  secret listing wrongly suggested the flag was absent.)
- **Resolution (migration 0097 + code):** privileged resets now REQUIRE all three security-question
  answers to verify, independent of the flag, and fail CLOSED when answers are unset. Added
  `user_security_answers` (scrypt-hashed, RLS/service-role only) + `profiles.sessions_valid_after`
  force-logout epoch (privileged tokens issued before it are rejected). `/auth/me` exposes
  `securitySetupRequired`; the web shows a mandatory non-dismissible setup gate. See docs/32.
  ROLLOUT COMPLETED 2026-08-21: migration 0097 applied; API deployed to Fly invest254-api; web deployed
  via Cloudflare Pages (commit 26b630a); force-logout stamped for all 3 privileged accounts. Verified in
  prod: reset on a real admin phone returns 403 SECURITY_QUESTIONS_NOT_SET (fail-closed, no change).
  Full suite 610 pass / 0 fail.

## #5 — Demo/marketer classifier was NOT site-scoped → players bypassed the withdrawal pool — FIXED (migration 0100)
- **What:** `fn_is_marketer_account` (0084) matched a profile to the `marketers` cohort on **phone
  (significant-9) alone, across ALL brands** — no `site_id` filter. But 0076 made `marketers` per-site
  and docs/20 §7 defines marketer identity as per-site. So a real **player on brand B** whose phone
  collided with a marketer on brand A was classified demo/marketer on brand B.
- **Symptoms (reported):** "global pool fund not applying to some clients (e.g. 33traders)" and "players
  using game config meant for marketers instead of the pool fund."
- **Mechanism (confirmed end-to-end):** engine `loadIsMarketer` → `fn_is_marketer_account` → wrongly
  true → `poolPath = poolActive && !isMarketer` = false → the player **skips the withdrawal pool and
  settles on the statistical ("marketer") path**, and the money layer (0086) routes them to the demo
  bucket. Not a mirror/template or deployment issue — the defect is in applied SQL affecting every brand;
  33traders is a normal row in the primary DB and pools correctly once classification is right.
- **Evidence (live):** 13 `role=player` accounts flagged as marketer; 5 were pure cross-site
  contamination (no marketer on their own site): 33traders/boyz, 66investors/Mercy, tamutraders/boyz,
  madolar/jake, invest254/grace254_waithera. The predicate also drives finance/RTP exclusion + money
  routing, so it mis-bucketed money too.
- **Fix (0100):** a user is demo/marketer IFF a `marketers` row exists **on the user's own site**
  (significant-9 match) **OR** the profile is `role='marketer'` (safety: never un-demo an enrolled
  marketer — 0084 warns that would turn funny-money into withdrawable cash). Rolled-back validation:
  player-flagged 13→8 (the 5 cross-site players become real pool players; all had 0 balance / 0 trades),
  marketer-flagged 10→12 (ALL enrolled marketers stay demo; moha KES 3,152 and jake KES 3,005 demo
  balances preserved). Additive, idempotent, reversible, money-neutral.
- **Follow-up (data hygiene) — DONE:** `madolar/moha` and `safitraders/jake` were `role=marketer` with
  live demo balances but had **no `marketers` row on their own brand** — an artifact of 0076 backfilling
  every pre-existing marketer to the default site (invest254). Enrolled them properly on their own brand
  via `fn_marketer_create` (active row + `marketer_wallets`), leaving the invest254 rows untouched;
  audited as `marketer.enroll.backfill` in `admin_actions`. Their classification now resolves via the
  site-scoped same-site match (not just the `role='marketer'` safety clause). NOTE: no marketer-dashboard
  PIN was set for the new brand identities — set one via the marketer admin if they need to log in there.
## #6 — Pool RTP tracked pool-size, not house_edge (Bug 1) — FIXED (pool RTP redesign, docs/25 §14)
- **What:** the pool controller paced payouts against `pool_amount × elapsed_day_fraction`, so realized
  player RTP tracked how big the daily pool was relative to turnover — not the operator's `house_edge`.
- **Evidence:** `sessionWinProbability` pace term was `(amount·dayFraction − paid)/amount`. With a pool
  large relative to turnover, `paid` sits far behind pace every trade, pinning win-prob at `pCap`. With
  the pre-redesign defaults (`pCap 0.6`, `meanMultiplier 1.8`) that yields `E[RTP] = 0.6·1.8 = 108%`.
  Simulation of the real decision fn confirmed RTP saturating well above the intended `1 − house_edge`.
- **Impact:** RTP was effectively set by pool sizing, not the configured edge; on generously-sized pools
  the house could pay ~100%+ RTP.
- **Resolution:** pace realized RTP toward `targetRtp × cumulative_turnover` (player-only, per site-day);
  the pool `available()` becomes only the hard cash fuse. Net: `realized RTP = min(targetRtp,
  pool/turnover)`. Turnover is tracked in-memory + DB-seeded (no migration).

## #7 — No structural positive-edge guarantee; low-volume days ran underwater (Bug 2) — FIXED (docs/25 §14)
- **What:** nothing guaranteed cumulative payout stayed below turnover. A fixed probability cap bounds
  only the *expected* per-trade edge, not realized aggregate RTP.
- **Evidence:** driving the real engine over 400 simulated days at 8 trades/day (strict `pCap = base`,
  no ceiling) ended **above 100% RTP on 116/400 days** (house net loss), max day 177%; even high-volume
  days spiked intraday RTP to 124–135%.
- **Impact:** on thin/low-volume brand-days, the house could and did (in simulation) lose money.
- **Resolution:** a HARD RTP-budget ceiling in `decidePoolOutcome` — `paid + reserved ≤ ⌊targetRtp ×
  turnover⌋` at all times (subtracting reserved makes it concurrency-safe across in-flight positions).
  Guarantees realized RTP ≤ target at **every** volume; simulation: 0/400 days over target, `maxIntraday
  = target` exactly. The pool `available()` remains the absolute cash fuse.

## #8 — Pool and statistical engines disagreed on win frequency (Bug 3) — FIXED (docs/25 §14)
- **What:** the pool used hardcoded knobs (`targetSessionRtp 0.6`, `meanMultiplier 1.8`) disconnected from
  each brand's `site_game_config`, so pool win frequency (base `0.6/1.8 = 0.33`) did not match the
  statistical engine's `targetWinRate` (default `0.125`). A player's win cadence changed with pool mode.
- **Resolution:** derive the pool's `meanMultiplier = targetRtp / targetWinRate` (the same `rtp/winRate`
  the `SettlementEngine` calibrates to), so pool base win-prob = `targetWinRate`. Both engines now share
  `targetWinRate` and both deliver RTP = `1 − house_edge`. `game.ts` threads `cfg.targetWinRate` into the
  controller; an infeasible config falls back to the default multiplier (defence-in-depth).

## #9 — Marketer/demo funny-money polluted real analytics (raw-table queries) — FIXED (migration 0101)
- **What:** money-bearing rows (positions/ledger/transactions/wallets) for the marketer/demo cohort
  live in the same tables as real players. Reports that used the cohort exclusion were correct, but any
  query that omitted it mixed demo funny-money into real figures — e.g. a raw `sum(positions.stake)`
  read ~KES 9.75M of demo turnover as real, producing a wildly wrong demand/RTP interpretation.
- **Evidence:** `positions` held 8,391 rows but the dashboard (which excludes `marketer_account_ids`)
  counted 2,128 real bets; the excess 6,263 were marketer demo bets (incl. a KES 4.7M single-day burst).
- **Root cause:** no enforced "real data" surface — cohort exclusion was applied per-query, so it could
  be forgotten.
- **Resolution (0101):** canonical `v_real_*` / `v_demo_*` views over the live classifier
  (`marketer_account_ids`), correct-by-construction and drift-free; `fn_demo_isolation_report()` proves
  0 leakage; `fn_platform_overview` rewired onto the views (identical output). Data hygiene: the
  6,263 marketer demo positions + 12,087 demo ledger rows + 426 demo transactions were removed and the
  demo wallets reset (real player data provably untouched); a bug-inflated madolar test account was
  deleted; and seeded pool caps were zeroed. See docs/27.

## #10 — Marketer app login rejected valid phone formats (false NOT_MARKETER) — FIXED (issue: marketer app login)
- **What:** the generic marketer app (mpesa/truecaller builds) showed "This account isn't registered
  as a marketer" (403 NOT_MARKETER) and the transaction feed/notifications never loaded, for a
  marketer whose website password and ledger were valid — whenever she typed her phone in any format
  other than the exact stored string (e.g. `+254706597235`, `254706597235`, `706597235`,
  `0706 597 235` vs stored `0706597235`).
- **Evidence:** read-only production comparison on the affected number (sig9 `706597235`, default
  brand): the old exact-match query found the row only for the stored format (1/6 formats); the
  sig9-match query finds it for all 6. Both marketer apps send the phone exactly as typed
  (no client-side normalization).
- **Root cause:** `profileByPhone` in `apps/api/src/marketers.pg.ts` matched `phone = $1` on the raw,
  un-normalized request string, while `auth.login` normalizes via `normalizeMsisdn` — so the password
  check succeeded but the marketer-wallet lookup missed. It was the one marketer lookup never migrated
  to the canonical significant-9-digits rule (`fn_phone_sig9`, migrations 0084/0086/0100, docs/29).
  The route tests passed because the in-memory double in `testutil.ts` replicated the same exact-match
  flaw and the fixtures never varied the phone format.
- **Impact:** any marketer typing their number in a non-stored format was locked out of the app with a
  misleading "not a marketer" error; downstream, the app's poll worker no-ops without a session, so
  M-Pesa-style transaction notifications silently stopped.
- **Resolution:** `profileByPhone` now matches on
  `fn_phone_sig9(phone) = fn_phone_sig9($1)` (with the `length(...) = 9` guard, site-scoped,
  deterministic `ORDER BY created_at ASC LIMIT 1`) — the same predicate as every other marketer
  lookup. The in-memory double keys phones by sig9 to stay faithful. New regression test
  ("login-web accepts the phone in any valid format") covers 6 format variants end to end.
  Full suite green (672/672); typecheck clean. No schema or write-path changes.

## #11 — Non–site-owner marketers earned no commission; some brands had no default marketer — FIXED (migration 0103)
- **What:** marketer dashboards showed no commissions for many marketers (e.g. *joy*, *Mohane*).
- **Evidence (read-only, production):** of 807 profiles only 4 had `referred_by` set; commissions
  flowed **only** to site owners via the `sites.owner_user_id` fallback. 4 brands had **no** default
  marketer (`owner_user_id IS NULL`): invest254, muchwins, tamutraders, 66investors — so every
  deposit on those brands paid **0%**. Verified *moha* (madolar owner) already earned exactly 25%.
- **Root cause:** (1) 4 brands were never assigned a default marketer, so their deposits paid no
  commission; (2) `fn_pay_referral_commissions` (0081) only rooted at the default marketer for
  **unreferred** deposits — a sub-marketer referral could take the whole 25% and leave the default
  marketer with nothing, so the hierarchy wasn't guaranteed.
- **Model (confirmed with operator):** each brand has ONE **default marketer**; **every deposit pays
  25%** into the brand's **hierarchical** marketer tree, always rooted at the default marketer.
- **Resolution (0103):**
  * `fn_pay_referral_commissions` now **always roots the 25% differential chain at the brand's
    default marketer** — full 25% when unreferred; differential split (recruiter bulk + upline
    overrides, default marketer at root) when a sub-marketer referred the depositor. Totals always
    sum to exactly 25%. Self-pay blocked; idempotent via `(deposit_tx_id, beneficiary_user)`.
  * Default marketers assigned: **invest254 → joy**, **muchwins → sheila** (single-marketer brands
    auto-assigned generically). **tamutraders** — the lone marketer (a duplicate *joy*) was demoted
    to player per operator instruction; brand left with no default. **66investors** — no marketer
    exists; skipped.
  * Docs 09 §3 and 19 updated to the 25%-of-deposits hierarchical model.
- **Verification:** rolled-back e2e against the live schema — unreferred→owner 25%; sub-marketer
  referral→recruiter 20% + default 5%; owner self-deposit→no pay; sub-marketer self-deposit→default
  25%; idempotent re-run→0 new rows; all marketer totals == 25%. Referral + affiliate TS suites green.


## #12 — Post-outage pool starvation: every brand paid 100% losses — FIXED (anti-starvation floor, docs/25 §15.6)
- **What:** starting the day trading resumed after the Aug 26–Sep 10 paybill outage, **every** pool-mode
  brand paid **0 wins** — players lost 100% of trades. invest254's daily withdrawal pool had fallen to
  **KES 47.49** (4,749 cents), far below a single 250-KES minimum stake.
- **Evidence (read-only, production):**
  * `position_decision ⨝ positions` by EAT day: invest254 win rates were healthy before the outage
    (Aug 24–27: 66–77%, large payouts) then **0 wins** on Sep 10–11 (10 decisions). Same 0-win pattern
    on madolar (32 dec), muchwins (45 dec, all `digit`), 33traders, safitraders.
  * `withdrawal_pool` for invest254 collapsed 8.25M (Aug 25) → 3.2M (Sep 1–9) → **34,173 (Sep 10) →
    4,749 (Sep 11)** cents. `sites.default_daily_pool_cents` history mirrored it.
  * Reproduced the demand allocator exactly (muchwins/safitraders/33traders matched to the cent):
    invest254's EMA forecast had decayed to ~85k cents (from millions), and the per-brand cap
    `2.5 × required` meant **even a KES 10M envelope would fund invest254 only ~KES 2,023**.
  * Player **@bill** (invest254): on the funded day Aug 27 he had 45 trades, **35 wins (77.8%)** yet
    RTP **0.870** — confirming the edge invariant works when the pool is funded (players win, house
    still edges out); the failure was funding, not the edge.
- **Root cause:** the demand-based pool allocator (docs/25 §15) forecasts demand with a **reactive EMA**
  over recent daily pool turnover. The ~2-week payment outage drove turnover to ~0, decaying the EMA →
  `required = targetRtp × forecast → 0`, which (via the `capMult × required` cap and the cap-clamped
  §15.2 floor) starved each brand's `default_daily_pool_cents` to ~zero. In the controller, **every
  payout gate scales with the pool `amount`** — the cash fuse `available = amount − paid − reserved`
  and the per-player no-scoop share `playerShare × amount` — so a starved amount forces every decided
  win to clamp to a loss (`reserved ≤ stake → loss`, and for fixed-odds `digit` contracts `payout >
  playerShare × amount → loss`). A self-reinforcing death spiral: starved pool → 100% loss → players
  leave → turnover stays 0 → forecast stays 0.
- **Resolution:**
  * **Immediate (production, audited RPCs, never-reduce `max(current, floor)`):** re-funded today's
    `withdrawal_pool.amount` and `default_daily_pool_cents` for all 7 active-with-demand brands to
    `round(targetRtp × robust expected daily turnover)` — invest254 → **KES 70,130**, muchwins → KES
    44,752 (default kept at its higher 61,144), madolar → 19,755, 33traders → 12,307, safitraders →
    950, tamutraders → 1,306, cpfmarket → 238. Verified the structural clamp is gone (avail ≫ any win,
    `playerShare×amount` ≫ payouts).
  * **Code (branch `fix/pool-allocation-floor`):** added a guaranteed anti-starvation floor decoupled
    from the reactive forecast — `floor_i = max(configuredFloorCents, targetRtp × expectedTurnover_i)`,
    `expectedTurnover = max(EMA, robustExpectedTurnover(baseline))`, where `robustExpectedTurnover =
    max(p75(non-zero days), mean(last 7 non-zero days))`. Allocated before the water-fill, rationed only
    if `Σ floors > envelope` (`Σ alloc ≤ G` preserved). Floors gate on demonstrated demand, so
    never-active brands stay 0. Safe by construction: pool `amount` is only a ceiling — the controller's
    `paid + reserved ≤ ⌊targetRtp × turnover⌋` cap still bounds payout to `targetRtp × turnover`, so the
    edge invariant (RTP ≤ 1 − house_edge) is unchanged. `PlatformService.poolDemand` feeds the robust
    baseline over `baselineDays` (default 45) + `POOL_MIN_FLOOR_CENTS`; daily script surfaces the floor.
- **Verification:** shared pool suites green (40/40, incl. 7 new incident-scenario tests: outage-collapse,
  huge-envelope-no-longer-clamps, Σfloor>G rationing, floor-is-a-minimum, configured-floor gating,
  back-compat byte-for-byte no-op); engine pool/controller/game suites green (35/35); engine typecheck
  clean. **Live read-only dry-run** of the new allocator over production history: invest254 forecast
  still KES 851.8 but floor lifts suggested to **KES 70,130** (was KES 835 under the old allocator);
  muchwins floored at 44,752 then demand-topped to 61,144; dead brands 0; Σ ≤ envelope.
- **Operational follow-ups:** (1) redeploy engine/api so the console `distribute-dynamic` uses the floor
  (the scheduled §15.5 workflow picks it up on merge to main); (2) until deployed, do NOT run a manual
  dynamic distribution on the old deployed code — it would re-starve. Revisit #43 next.

## #12b — Defense-in-depth so pool starvation can never silently re-occur (docs/25 §15.7)
Follow-up to #12. The §15.6 allocation floor removes the *cause*; these three independent layers
guarantee a silent recurrence (from that cause or any other) is effectively impossible:
- **(A) Absolute allocation floor** — `POOL_MIN_FLOOR_CENTS` (repo var) → `configuredFloorCents`, wired
  into `pool-distribute.yml`. A hard global minimum for cases the robust baseline can't cover (outage
  longer than `baselineDays`, brand-new brands). Operator dial; default off.
- **(B) DB safety valve — ALWAYS ON (migration 0119, applied to prod).** `fn_pool_ensure_day` now seeds
  a pool-mode brand's day at `greatest(default_daily_pool_cents, ⌈min_stake × max_multiplier ÷ 0.15⌉)`,
  so a zero/mis-set/starved default can never again force 100% losses — independent of any allocator
  run. Money-safe (amount is only a ceiling; controller still caps payout at ⌊targetRtp × turnover⌋).
  Verified live (rolled-back tx): safitraders default 95k → seed 833,334; invest254 default 7.01M wins.
- **(C) Active monitor — closes the detection gap.** `scripts/pool_health_monitor.py` +
  `.github/workflows/pool-health.yml` (every 30 min). Unlike `winrate_monitor.py` (needs ≥50 samples —
  and starvation suppresses volume, so it stayed silent during #12), this watches the STRUCTURAL signal
  over a rolling 2h window (`POOL_STARVED`: available < one min stake with live trades; `ALL_LOSS`: ≥8
  live trades, 0 wins; `BELOW_VIABLE` warning) and pages Telegram. Verified against live prod: after the
  #12 re-fund it reports ✅ healthy and shows invest254 already paying wins again (1 win / 2 recent
  trades; avail 7,012,995 → 6,987,681).
- **APIs redeployed** (fly.io `invest254-engine-pm` + `invest254-api`, remote build from merged main) so
  the console `distribute-dynamic` path also uses the §15.6 floor; API health 200, engine WS up.

## #15 — Deriv/digits ~80% player losses: near-miss fired even for above-line players — FIXED (docs/25 §16)
- **What:** the deriv (digits) game paid ~7–20% wins (≈80–93% losses) — far below the ~50% an even/odd
  contract should pay (RTP 0.95 ⇒ ~50/50). Reported as "deriv bot making 80% losses".
- **Evidence (read-only prod + deterministic replay):** muchwins digits last 24h = 5 wins / 67 (7.5%).
  Replaying the 29 most-recent decisions from their stored `seed+nonce`: mean propensity roll 0.529
  (RNG **fair**), propensity losses 15/29 (52% ≈ fair 50/50), and **14/29 were would-be WINS** (roll < p)
  — of which the near-miss voided 12, cutting the win rate from ~48% to ~7%. Not RNG, not the pool
  (funded), not propensity: the near-miss lever.
- **Root cause:** the min-withdrawal near-miss (docs/25 goal-gradient) fired whenever
  `bal + payout ≥ W`, **regardless of whether the player was already at/above the withdrawal line**. So
  any player/bot trading with a funded balance ≥ W had ~85% of wins voided (fixed-odds digits) or held
  (rise/fall) — a blanket win-suppression instead of the intended "hold a player JUST BELOW the line as
  they approach it". Worsened by the pre-§16 line being the low legacy KES value (KES 2,000 ≈ $15), which
  nearly every funded player exceeded.
- **Fix:** the near-miss now engages ONLY on the crossing trade — `bal < W && bal + payout ≥ W` — in BOTH
  engines (`decidePoolOutcome` variable / curve+candlestick, and `decidePoolOutcomeFixed` fixed / deriv).
  A player already at/above the line wins normally and can withdraw (real withdrawals = social proof, as
  intended). Combined with §16's currency-native line ($200 for USD), the lever now engages only in the
  genuine goal-gradient band. The house edge is untouched (the RTP-budget cap `paid+reserved ≤ ⌊target×
  turnover⌋` still bounds payout).
- **Verification:** `pool.test.ts` — "near-miss fires ONLY on the crossing trade; above-line players win
  normally" (asserts above-line near-miss count == 0 and ~base win rate for BOTH engines; crossing still
  triggers; far-below unaffected). Existing crossing/far-below near-miss tests still pass. 17/17 pool,
  30/30 engine pool/game, engine+api typecheck clean.
