# Bug Log

Running log of bugs caught (new or pre-existing) while working through issues, with status. Each
entry: what, evidence, root cause, impact, and resolution.

---

## #1 — Bonus subsystem was dormant in the live money RPCs — FIXED (issue 1 / migration 0094)
- **What:** `bonus_balance` was frozen platform-wide — it could never be staked, wagered, or converted.
- **Evidence:** Live `fn_open_position` (10-arg) and `fn_settle_position` only moved `real`/`demo`
  balances; the `bonuses` table was empty across all 9 brands.
- **Root cause:** the original 0037 bonus mechanics were dropped when the RPCs were rewritten for
  site-scoping (0047) and demo isolation (0084). Deposit-bonus *granting* was also removed at 0077/0078.
- **Impact:** any credit to `bonus_balance` would have been permanently unusable and non-withdrawable.
- **Resolution:** migration 0094 restores bonus-first staking, wagering accrual, and FIFO conversion in
  the site-scoped/demo-aware RPCs (additive; verified no-op for existing zero-bonus accounts). See docs/31.

## #2 — DepositForm advertised a deposit bonus the backend never grants — FIXED (issue 1)
- **What:** the deposit screen showed a live "+KES X bonus (50%/25%/15%)… credited instantly as bonus
  balance" preview, but `fn_complete_deposit` (0078) grants no deposit bonus.
- **Resolution (per direction "remove any deposit-bonus apart from the one we just implemented"):**
  removed the DepositForm preview + `bonusPctForDeposit` import; deleted the shared deposit-tier module
  (`packages/shared/src/bonus.ts`, its `./bonus` package export, the engagement re-export, and its
  tests); and dropped the orphaned `fn_deposit_bonus_pct` in migration 0094. The **only** bonus in the
  system is now the sign-up welcome bonus. (Legacy `bonus_config.tiers/wagering_x` columns are left
  inert.)

## #3 — Admin "day" finance report is timezone-fragile (fails 00:00–03:00 EAT) — OPEN (pre-existing)
- **What:** `app.admin.isolation.e2e.test.ts` → "finance reports (daily/day/users) are brand-scoped"
  fails: `day report: brand A only` expects 40000, gets 0.
- **Evidence:** Reproduced on a clean `main` (pre-existing; independent of issue 1). The test derives
  `today` via `Africa/Nairobi` (`toLocaleDateString('en-CA', { timeZone: 'Africa/Nairobi' })`) while the
  deposit rows are grouped by their stored (UTC) date. When the run happens in the window where the
  Nairobi calendar date is already ahead of UTC (00:00–03:00 EAT), the requested day and the stored day
  disagree and the report returns 0.
- **Impact:** the `/admin/reports/day` aggregation and/or the test are not timezone-consistent; the
  report can under-count near the UTC/EAT day boundary. Test is flaky by wall-clock (green during Nairobi
  daytime).
- **Status:** documented, NOT fixed under issue 1 (unrelated to the welcome bonus; changing day-report
  timezone handling on a live financial report warrants its own scoped fix + decision on the canonical
  reporting timezone).

## #4 — Phone-only password reset is account takeover for admins/superadmins — FIXED (issue 2 / migration 0097)
- **What:** `POST /api/v1/auth/password/reset` sets a new password from phone + new password alone
  (no possession proof), gated only by `ALLOW_UNVERIFIED_PASSWORD_RESET`. For a privileged account
  (admin / superadmin / platform_superadmin) anyone who knows the phone number could seize the back
  office.
- **Evidence:** `AuthService.resetPassword` had no second factor for privileged roles; the only reset
  path is that public endpoint (no admin-panel reset exists). Production roles are player/marketer/
  admin/platform_superadmin — note there is NO literal `superadmin`, so the real top account is
  `platform_superadmin` and had to be included in the privileged set.
- **Impact:** full account takeover of any admin whose phone number is known, IF the flag is enabled.
  The flag is currently OFF in production (reset returns RESET_DISABLED), so it was not live-exploitable
  at fix time, but a single env flip would have opened it.
- **Resolution (migration 0097 + code):** privileged resets now REQUIRE all three security-question
  answers to verify, independent of the flag, and fail CLOSED when answers are unset. Added
  `user_security_answers` (scrypt-hashed, RLS/service-role only) + `profiles.sessions_valid_after`
  force-logout epoch (privileged tokens issued before it are rejected). `/auth/me` exposes
  `securitySetupRequired`; the web shows a mandatory non-dismissible setup gate. See docs/32.
  Force-logout of current admins is a deliberate rollout step (stamp `sessions_valid_after = now()`
  for privileged roles) run after the API/web deploy. Full suite 609 pass / 0 fail.
