# 44 — Operator console UI overhaul (UI-A … )

Owner request (2026-09-23): *"improve the UI — the sidebar (use dividers etc), make sure the UI is well presented,
well organized, and easy to use … all UI interfaces. Fix confusing or dead designs … Focus on all admin levels."*

## Method

1. **Audit on realistic data.** A local database is built from every migration and seeded with a System owner, a
   platform (Alpha Markets) with two brands, a platform admin, brand admins, marketers, 25 players with deposits,
   bets and withdrawals, tickets and audit rows. The real API runs against it and the production web build is
   screenshotted per tier (brand admin, platform admin, System owner) at desktop (1440) and phone (390) widths:
   74 screens. Nothing touches production.
2. **Reference patterns.** NN/g vertical navigation and menu guidelines (visible left nav, labelled groups,
   "you are here", frequent items first, familiar patterns), Atlassian side navigation, Shopify Polaris and the
   shadcn/ui sidebar anatomy (workspace header, labelled groups, separators, footer user menu, icon-rail
   collapse with ⌘/Ctrl+B, sheet on mobile).
3. **One issue at a time**, each with failing checks first (role e2e in headless Chromium), then the fix, then
   merge → deploy → verify.

## Findings (abridged; P1 = broken/misleading)

| Area | P1 | P2 (selection) |
|---|---|---|
| Navigation shell | owner collapse chevron drawn over page titles; no Log out on phones; phone strip hid the current page | flat lists of 10–16 items; duplicate icons; loud active fill; unclear/near-duplicate labels; "client"/"brand"/"site" and "System admin"/"System owner" used interchangeably |
| Shared components | "now ago" relative time | 3 date formats; mixed money formats and wrapping; table header casing/number alignment; disabled buttons never say why; three tab styles; badge colours/casing |
| Pages | Withdrawals Reject/Mark paid clipped; announcement "edit the body" with no body field; read-only overrides that look editable; fake "▲100%" deltas; two phone pages scroll sideways | nearly-empty Billing/Deployment pages; duplicated pool controls; developer notes in the UI; jargon (RTP, GGR, drift) unexplained |

## UI-A — navigation shell (this change)

One shared `ConsoleShell` (components/console) for every admin tier, navigation defined once in
`components/console/nav.tsx` (capability-gated on the token role):

- **Brand admin**: Overview · MONEY Withdrawals, Finance, Marketer payouts, Reports · PLAYERS Users, Announcements ·
  SUPPORT Player chats, Platform tickets · BRAND Add-ons & gateways.
- **Platform admin**: Overview, Tickets · BRANDS Onboard brand, Domain registrar · MONEY Payment accounts,
  Withdrawal pool · OVERSIGHT Audit log · ACCOUNT Billing.
- **System owner**: Overview, Tickets · BRANDS & PLATFORMS Platforms, Onboard brand, Domain registrar, Brand back
  office · MONEY Payment accounts, Gateways, M-Pesa defaults, Withdrawal pool · COMMERCIAL Billing, Add-ons &
  requests · SYSTEM Controls & economy, Audit log, System logs, Deployment.

Details: workspace header that truncates instead of overflowing; labelled groups with dividers (dividers stay in
the collapsed rail); one current item (longest match; a brand page keeps Overview current) with a quiet highlight
and accent bar; a distinct icon per destination; footer with collapse (⌘/Ctrl+B) and the account (avatar,
@username, role, Log out); ⌘K palette lists every page of the tier plus brands. Phones: sticky top bar naming
the current page + a drawer with the same navigation and Log out (Escape/backdrop close, scroll lock).
The owner's brand picker now opens inside the console. Page titles match nav labels; role names come from one
helper (`lib/roles.ts`: System owner / Platform admin / Brand admin).

Tests: `nav.test.ts` (unique routes/labels, tier separation, current-item rules); role e2e +16 checks (grouping,
header containment, current item, all routes reachable, distinct icons, picker inside the console, phone drawer
with current page + Log out + Escape, no sideways scroll) — 15 failed before, all pass after.

## UI-B — shared formatting and primitives

- One time/date/number vocabulary (`lib/format.ts`): `formatAgo`, `formatDate`, `formatDateTime`, `formatNumber`, all en-KE. Money is `formatKes` / `<Money>`, which never wraps.
- `Th`/`Td` take `numeric` (right-aligned, tabular, no wrap). Headers never wrap, and sortable headers use the same casing as the others.
- `StatCard` values never wrap. `StatusBadge` uses sentence case and never wraps. `Empty` takes an action. `PageHeader` caps its subtitle width and wraps its actions.
- `SearchInput`: one 36px toolbar search with an icon.
- Disabled buttons use a neutral style whatever their variant, and can carry a tooltip that says why.
- Overview: "Brands" (was "Clients") and "Onboard brand". The KPI grid now wraps as 4 + 3 instead of squeezing 7 tiles until values truncate.

## UI-C — page-level P1 fixes

- **Withdrawals.** The Action column is pinned to the right edge and the phone view uses cards. The columns are Player (with phone and receipt), Amount, Status, Balance, Lifetime (in/out/net) and Requested. Above the table sits one summary line ("2 awaiting review · KES 1,520 held"), and the kill switch is a compact row.
- **Announcements.** Title and message can be edited and are sent through migration 0162. There is a live preview, a plain count of people, and a brand-scoped "Remove active notices".
- **Overview trends.** A metric with no activity in the earlier half shows "New", never a fake "▲100%". Each metric is coloured by what counts as good news for it.
- **User page.** Read-only overrides are shown as values.
- **Tabs.** `PageTabs` (underline tabs, arrow-key navigation, scrolls on phones) replaces the old tab controls. `useTabParam` keeps the open tab in the URL. The brand page gains an Add-ons tab.
