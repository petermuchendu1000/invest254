# Invest254 backend image — runs the WS game engine (8080) and/or REST API (8081).
# Source-first: the services run via `tsx`, so there is NO compile/build step.
# The same image is deployed as two Fly apps (see fly.engine.toml / fly.api.toml),
# each overriding the start command via its own [processes] block.
#
# apps/web (Next.js) is deliberately NOT in this image — it ships to Cloudflare Pages.

#    npm ci handles the missing workspace and skips its dependencies.

# Default: run BOTH services in one container (website / single-app deploy via root
# fly.toml). The engine binds 8080 and the API binds 8081 from their own defaults
# (neither PORT env is set, so they don't collide). The per-app CLI configs
# (fly.engine.toml / fly.api.toml) override this with a single-service [processes].
